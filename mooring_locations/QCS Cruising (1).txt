Ship Cove (Meretoto)
-41.0583, 174.2372 
This bay is attractive and the surrounding hills are completely covered with native bush. There is a substantial wharf here as well as toilets, fireplaces and shelters around the grassy areas along the foreshore.
A swift river comes out into the bay between the wharf and monument and holding in this area can be very poor. Water is piped to the wharf.
A marked track leads from near the wharf to Resolution Bay. This track tends to be muddy and is through native bush.
A lookout has been constructed about two-thirds of the way to the saddle on the Ship Cove side. There is a good view from the lookout and saddle. It takes about one and a half hours to walk to Resolution Bay.
Ship Cove collects considerable swell from the open sea, particularly near the wharf. The combined club mooring on the north-west side of the bay also gets some of the swell.
The mooring is safe in winds from W to NE. There is still shelter in SW winds but it can be rather gusty.
The coves from the north-east of the mooring are well sheltered in W to NE winds and miss the swell from the open sea. These coves give good anchorage with deep water close to the shore.
The only satisfactory part of Ship Cove in SE to S winds is to the eastern side of the wharf. The water is deep here and if close to the shore there is no wind. The western side of the wharf is not deep and gets progressively shallower from the wharf to the river mouth. Mooring to the wharf is prohibited.
The bay to the south of Ship Cove gives good shelter in SE to SW winds to boats anchored either swinging free or with a stern line to shore. The holding is good with a mud, sand bottom.
There is a rock close to the shore on the western side, about 200 meters north of the beach at the head of the bay. There is a combined club mooring here.
From Ship Cove to Motuara Island N sector winds tend to be very strong with frequent gusts. Winds from S semicircle also blow strongly through here, with a considerable height of sea. Yachts under sail should proceed with caution and should not be over canvassed.

Jacksons Bay 
-41.2167, 174.3167 
As in Te Awaiti, the whole of this bay is shallow and only about three meters deep. The bottom is a mixture of malodorous (foul-smelling) sand and mud that grips anchors like glue.
The bay is an excellent anchorage in winter months. During summer months, green lettuce seaweed will clog anchors. This bay is sheltered from all except E to SE winds and misses most of the ferry wash.
There is little depth of water past the wharf at LW.
At the end of the wharf there is two meters of water. The bay is good holding but exposed to most winds.

Te Awaiti Bay
-41.2181, 174.3214 
The bay was the site of a whaling station from the 1830s onwards. Remains of old whaling pots are still mounted on the foreshore.
Although open to public access, it should be remembered that the hinterland is privately owned.
The holding is good in this bay, provided a pick anchor is used, as the bottom has a thick covering of cabbage-like seaweed that most anchors will easily slide on.
Te Awaiti Bay is shallow close to the shore and is no more than about 4 m deep over the greater area of the bay. This is reasonable anchorage but in fresh to strong conditions, it can be rather draughty.
In S conditions the bay is a little too exposed and most shelter is in lee of the rocky islets. The bay is open to ferry wash.
The channel between Arapawa Island and the inner islet has a clear depth of at least 2m but contains a lot of seaweed. Local knowledge is desirable.

Like Okukari Bay, this bay is exposed to surge from the open sea and is most uncomfortable in S conditions when the swell comes in from Cook Strait.
However, Whekenui is rather more sheltered from N winds. Both bays get the full force of the ferry wash.
During spring ebb tides, there is a strong counter current across the mouth of the bays that can be used to advantage.

Tory Channel Entrance
-41.24000; 174.23333
Tory Channel also known as Kura Te Au separates Arapaoa Island from Te Waipounamu.
Tidal streams of up to seven knots flow through the entrance to and from Cook Strait. These tidal streams cause a great deal of turbulence, which can be very dangerous.
In N sector winds the Tory Channel entrance usually poses little problem. However, S sector winds generally create a heavy ground swell and this swell, meeting the shore line, piles up creating a steep sea.
If combined with a strong outgoing tide, a series of dangerous breaking seas occur just outside the entrance. Passage through the entrance is undesirable in such conditions, especially in undecked boats, as they can be easily swamped.
Low-powered vessels trying to enter from Cook Strait against the outgoing tides will find least current close to West Head as far as Taranaki Rock. From there, the boat should be headed for Okukari Bay and allow itself to be swept over close to the northern shore. A counter-current forms along this area, as far around as Whekenui Bay.
If leaving Tory Channel against an incoming tide, least current is usually experienced close to West Head. During the incoming tide the current tends to sweep across the outer part of the entrance to the east and can carry boats on the dangers out from East Head.
There are several dangerous rocks in this area. Taranaki Rock on the West Head side dries at Spring Low Water and should be given a wide berth as the strong tide can easily sweep a boat on to the rock. There are rocks out to sea from both East and West Heads and both of these points should be given a clearance of 100 metres. From East Head to westward into the channel, there are rocks below the surface up to 30m from the shore.
At night the Tory Channel entrance is marked by a sectored light on East and West Heads. There are two leading lights in Okukari Bay which, when in line, indicate the centre of the channel.
The interisland ferries give warning of their approach to the entrance by a general call on VHF channels 16 and 18. These ships must be given right of way, as once in the entrance any emergency manoeuvres to avoid small craft would be nearly impossible. If in the entrance at the time that the ferry passes, keep well to the side and there will be plenty of room.

Whareunga Bay
  -41.1556, 174.3417
The bays between Patten passage and Whareunga Bay all have attractive beaches and are completely exposed to NW to NE winds. They should only be used as an anchorage in calm weather or in winds from the S sector semi-circle.
Holding is good at Kilmarnoch at the head of Whareunga.

There is a cairn, erected by the Mana Cruising Club in 1973, at the southernmost end of the beach.
The holding is good in a sandy bottom but the bay is open to all except SW conditions. It is a pleasant picnic spot but only recommended as an overnight anchorage in calm conditions.
The anchorage shown to the north of Burney’s Beach is a good picnic spot and is sheltered in N to SE winds. There is also limited shelter in moderate NW conditions. There is also a combined club mooring here.

There are a few beaches on the island which offer limited shelter only. The area is exposed to most winds but the southern coast has some good picnic spots which are well sheltered from wind and sea in NW to N to E.
A dangerous reef extends 300 meters from the north-western end of the island. The end of the reef is marked by an unlit red buoy.
The outer rock is marked by the buoy and marks Pickersgill Island. When both of the Twins are open on the western side of Clark Point you are just clear of the reef.
At night, once clear of the Patten Passage reef, steer NNW until the Motuara Island light is visible. This will lead one well clear of the reef off Pickersgill Island.

This very large bay is exposed to all winds and provides no really well-sheltered anchorages. There are parts on the weather shores that provide calm water but these are mostly open to the wind.
Onauku Bay ends in a shallow sandy beach with good farm land and extensive flat areas in a large valley. This valley causes the area to act as a wind funnel for all wind directions.The north-west side of the bay offers some shelter in NW winds with reasonable holding.
Near the entrance of Onauku Bay is Ngakuta Bay. This bay extends to the north-west and because of this tends to act as a wind funnel. It is however excellent holding with the bottom of the se being level and thus ensuring that anchors do not drag. The bay is a satisfactory anchorage in all winds but SE winds. Holding is mud and shell.
The bay between Onario Point and Clark Point is shallow close to shore and has a rock about 80 metres out form the shore, 350 metres north-east of Clark Point. There is moderate shelter here in NW to N winds. Clark Point should be given a clearance of 20 metres.

The coast here rises steeply and there are no beaches. Rocks extend the full length of the shore with deep water up to them. The sea along this coast is relatively calm in NW winds. Tidal streams set north with the rising tide and south with the falling tide. Within a mile from the shore, the tidal stream changes about half an hour after the Tory Channel streams. Further out, the tidal streams are less predictable and the table on chart NZ46 should be consulted.

Cooper's (Papatoia)
-41.1167, 174.2917
This name is locally applied to the bay on the south side of Cooper Point. There are rocks in the bay as well as rocks of Cooper and Kotukutuku Point. This latter point should be given a clearance of 150 metres.
The bay gives shelter in N to S winds and limited shelter in moderate NW winds, if anchored in the extreme north-eastern end of the bay.
There is a combined club mooring here and it is suitable for only two or three boasts at most. The bay tends to be gusty in strong conditions and collects a swell form the open sea.
If anchored, it can be preferable not to put a stern line ashore and thus allow the boat to move and ease tension on the anchor cable during gusts.
Yachts using the passage between Cooper Point and Long Island in SE to S winds should stay to the Long Island side where the wind is steadier in force and direction.

Long (Kokomohua) island
-41.1192583; 174.2669572
This beautiful island, named after its shape and considerable length, is a protected island and is surrounded by marine reserve. The diving and snorkelling here is exceptional with fish, crayfish and paua ranging in sizes that are considered rare outside of a marine reserve.
Despite its magnificence as a scenic conservation area, the island does pose a number of dangers to boaties. There are rocks ten metres out from the north-western shore and off all points along the south-eastern shore of this island.
The islands are covered in native bush and the only beach of any size is on the south-west end. This is, however, very open to all wind.
Anchorage can be found in the bays midway along the island on the south-east side. These give shelter in W to N winds only. A stern line is necessary to be able to pull the boat out of the wind gusts coming over the top of the island.
The north-east end of the island has a long cluster of rocks and islets continuing seven tenths of a mile as an extension of the island. The islet shown nearest to Long Island is a rock about half a metre about HWS.
There is a boat passage between this rock and the islets further to the north-east. In the middle of this passage is a rock unmarked on pre-1970 charts.There is a lot of weed in the passage and it should only be used with local knowledge.
The rocks and weed continue for 500 metres below the surface north-eastwards from the last islet and terminate in a sunken rock. This rock is just to the south of a line from Cape Koamaru to the light on Motuara Island.
A safe clearance transit for the end of the reef is when The Twins are in line with the south-east end of Motungarara Island.
The southern end of the island has a reef extending to the south-west for about 120 metres with approximately two metres of water over it.

Cannibal Cove
-41.0417, 174.2750
Although seemingly protected by high hills this is an unsatisfactory place for an anchorage. Winds from W to N blow through the bay with considerable force. The bay is completely open to E to S winds.
The bottom is sandy and is not good holding. 
History
Anaho is the Māori name for this bay. It means, new bay or bay that runs deep.1
In 1770, the bay was named Cannibal Cove by Captain James Cook after the crew of the HMS Endeavour found human bones in the remains of a meal.
Archaeological evidence suggests a long history of human settlement in the bay. In 1777, the crew of Captain Cook’s ship, HMS Resolution, recorded that the papakāinga or village in the bay had a total of six huts, the largest of which was 24 feet long and 12 feet wide. The Europeans also noted the village was undefended and appeared to be temporary.2
By the nineteenth century the papakāinga at Anaho had increased to around 90 people and was one of the largest settlements in Queen Charlotte Sound/Tōtaranui. The inhabitants of the bay, from the iwi, Te Ātiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui, grew food in large gardens, kept livestock and harvested kaimoana or food from the sea.3
At this time the bay was also home to Arthur Cruickshank Elmslie and his wife, Erihapeti Pouakai.
Elmslie was born in England but arrived in the Marlborough Sounds during the 1830s. In 1833 he married Erihapeti Pouakai of Ngāti Koata and they divided their time between Anaho and the whaling station at Te Awaiti Bay in the Tory Channel.4
Their residence at Anaho was known as the summer house. It was the largest house in the papakāinga and was used as a communal gathering place for converts to Christianity. The house had wattle walls, was plastered with clay and thatched with rushes.
Anaho became well known throughout the Marlborough Sounds for its hospitality and was visited by many travellers to the area, including in 1839, representatives of the New Zealand Company.5
In 1907 a schooner, the Pet became stranded in the bay. Although damage to the vessel was minor, it was never recovered.6
The small bay to the north of Anaho is known as Little Waikawa. This name may refer to a water source in the bay that was unpleasant to the taste.7
During the 1770s, Captain Cook’s crew recorded two dwellings in Little Waikawa. These had disappeared by the 1830s when the settlement at Anaho was at its height.8

Cannibal Cove to Cape Jackson
-40.99392820, 174.31485720
This area has steep hills running down to the water’s edge and is deep close to shore. Rocks fringe the shore-line but generally there are no outlying dangers. Apart from the head of Cannibal Cove and some parts of Anakakata Bay, there are no beaches.
NW to N winds tend to become accelerated in this area and often blow up to twenty knots stronger than the main wind speed in Cook Strait.
This increased wind force is felt up to a mile from shore and yachts will usually find better sailing conditions well off this coast in N sector winds.
The area also tends to be very gusty in strong conditions. In NW to N winds, the sea is relatively calm close to shore from Cannibal Cove to Cape Jackson.
The northern part of Anakakata Bay has several rocks out from the shore and the coast here should be given a clearance of at least 100 meters.
In strong winds there can be dangerous tiderips and overfalls close to Waihi Point. These can be worse than the seas off Cape Jackson for the same wind conditions. 
Little Waikawa has reasonable shelter in winds NE flow and shelter from these winds if under 25 to 30 knots.

The small bays on the western side provide shelter in NW to N winds, while the two bays in the south-west end of the bay give best shelter in NW to N winds. Because there are a number of baches (holiday homes) in these bays, it is difficult to anchor with a line ashore without disturbing land owners.
The south-east end of the bay features a small cove with a house and a wharf. This cove is sheltered from all winds but is not deep close to shore. The owner’s moorings can make it difficult to anchor out of the wind.
The rest of this arm is good holding and gives reasonable shelter in winds from the S sector semi-circle. The bay shoals gently and it is best to keep at least 100 metres from the shore at the end of the bay.
Southern wharf is very exposed to N and NW wind and any ferry wash.

Such was the power of the wind that the old house that once stood at the head of the bay had hydrangeas growing 2 metres high covering the front windows: Although they kept the light out, they were reputed to have prevented stones flying off the beach from hurling through the windows by NW winds.
The Pilot recommends the outer part of the bay as an anchorage. This is fine if you are a big ship, otherwise the bay is not recommended in anything but calm conditions.
Some shelter can be obtained in N sector winds in the coves along the north-east shore, but it is shallow and difficult to get close enough to the shore to avoid the wind.
The eastern-most cove in the bay gives the only shelter in S conditions. Do not anchor in the head of the cove as although the water is calm, the wind funnels out of the valley.
The southern side of the cove misses most of the wind and is good holding.

In Te Pangu Bay, there is good holding and shelter on the western side of the wharf from all but N to SE winds. It is shallow with little more than 1.5 metres at the end of the wharf.
This bay is exposed to wash from the ferries travelling to and from Picton.
The south-east part of the bay is very shallow and locally called “Joe Roars”. The southern wind (“Joe”) certainly does roar through here, hence this bay is not recommended for anchorage except for shallow draft boats in NE conditions.
There is a large salmon farm moored in the outer part of the bay.

Te Weuweu (School) Bay
-41.2433, 174.2383
School Bay is so named because in the 1920s a school operated on the flat at the southern end of the bay serving the residents of this, Erie and Te Pangu bays.
There is a shallow sand bank extending across the mouth of the bay from Kaihinu Point: Boats drawing more than 1 metre should enter from the eastern side.
The beaches shelve gently and a reasonable distance should be kept from the shore.
Holding is good in all parts of the bay but is exposed to the prevailing winds from NW to N, and to some ferry wash.
In S winds Kaihinu Bay is the most sheltered part; the rest of the bay gets some wind but the water is calm.
Kaihinu Bay is steeped in Maori legend and was tapu until the 1960s. The then-owner of the bay reported noises and sounds of people from the past.
The tapu was the result of the massacre of the local tribes and subsequent feasting of Te Rauparaha’s victorious fighters.

Erie (Tauranga-Kawau) Bay
-41.25066731, 174.21220420


Like many of the Tory Channel bays, this has a sand bank at the entrance. The charted depth is 2 m but some silting seems to have occurred and boats of more than 1m draft may touch at spring low tide.
The channel on the western side has at least 12m of water with plenty of width. The channel on the eastern side has a minimum depth of 3m.
For deepest water it is necessary to keep close to Kaihinu Point. A tidal stream of up to two knots runs between the island and Kaihinu Point.
A reef extends due north about 10m from Kaihinu Point and is clearly discernible by its weed beds. There are no outlying dangers from the various weed beds or from the island.
The whole bay is excellent holding. The western side and extreme southern end gives best shelter in NW conditions, however the southern end is very gusty in S winds.
The large bay on the south eastern end is excellent shelter in N to E to SW conditions. Some shelter can also be gained from NW winds by anchoring with a line to shore in the north east corner, but the bay is not recommended in strong NW conditions. The western side and extreme southern end gives best shelter in NW conditions, but the southern end is very gusty in S winds. 
Historically, Moioio Island and Kaihinu Point both had large Maori settlements which were attacked by Maori chief Te Rauparaha and his warriors.

Opua Bay is a little too open for peaceful overnight anchorage in fresh or strong winds.
There is however shelter from northerly to north westerly winds in the northern side.
The eastern coast of this bay is shallow.
At the head of the bay there is a road access barge ramp for log barges which come and go continuously during harvesting times.

There seems to be a lot of confusion over the name of Anapua Bay: It is locally called “Onapua” and has been so since the turn of the century.
Chart NZ615 uses Onapua as the name of the coves on the south-west side about a third of the way in. ChartNZ6153 calls the whole bay Anapua.
Both names translate roughly as "stinking wind" and in the main part of the bay it sure does blow “like stink” regardless of the wind direction.
Overnight anchorage is not recommended anywhere in the main part of the bay.
The head of the bay has several attractive arms and useful anchorages and is reasonably sheltered from the wind.

Hitaua Bay
-41.25921315, 174.15981450
Hitaua Bay is a very popular anchorage, as it provides shelter from both wind and ferry wash.
The anchorage is located in the second bay on the western side. In the event of winds from SW to N to NE, the small cove on the northern side is a safe anchorage.
This position misses the wind and most of the wash from passing ferries.
There is a combined club mooring laid in the middle of the bay. This mooring is safe in all winds but can be gusty in strong conditions particularly from SE to S. There are many other private moorings.
About 15 metres to the south-west of this peninsula is a rock which is just below the surface at low tide.
Caution is necessary when entering this bay, particularly at night. The southern end of Hitaua Bay is shallow and too gusty for peaceful anchorage.
There are mussel farms on the eastern side at the entrance to the bay.
In winds from SW to N to NE, the small cove on the northern side is a safe anchorage. 
Hitaua Bay features area of historical interest, including the remains on a Maori pa on the narrow peninsula that protects the anchorage.
The saddle above the southern end of the bay is where Ngāti Toa chief and warrior Te Rauparaha had his canoes dragged across from Port Underwood to enable him to make a surprise attack on the Tory Channel Maori.

Ngaruru Bay
-41.22717808, 174.21577920
 
The western side of Ngaruru Bay provides the best protection from a southerly wind. The entire bay is badly affected by a south easterly wind. In strong gusts there can be half a metre of wave going ashore. Northerly and westerly winds do not present a problem.
The moorings in the bay are both affected by ferry wash. The mooring nearest the shore on the western side is a private mooring. The combined club mooring is closer to the middle of the bay.
The bay is slowly silting up and becoming shallower; this is reflected in the soundings on the nautical charts. All of the bay presents difficulty with anchoring because of weed and one should take care to ensure the anchor is well dug in.
Ngaruru is a scenic reserve.

Kawhia Bay
-41.2697, 174.0414
The entrance to this bay is very wide and although there is a sand bank in the middle, it is not extensive and is over three meters deep.
The bays on the eastern side have small beaches and are attractive; however, they are exposed to prevailing W to N winds.
Although giving shelter in SW to S winds, the small size of the bays and shallow depth make it difficult to get far enough into the bays to lay an anchor and be out of the wind.
The northern end of the bay offers limited shelter in N sector winds if close to the western shore.
N sector winds tend to be funnelled across from Umuwheke Bay and blow out into the channel with some force. The eastern side of the head of the bay gives best shelter in SE to S winds.

This bay is exposed to wash from the ferries travelling to and from Picton.
The south-east part of the bay is very shallow and locally called “Joe Roars”. The southern wind (“Joe”) certainly does roar through here, hence this bay is not recommended for anchorage except for shallow draft boats in NE conditions.
There is a large salmon farm moored in the outer part of the bay.

Deep Bay (Tory Channel)
-41.2403, 174.1683
The entrance to this bay is very shallow and blocked by a sand bank extending from the northern shore. There is 2.5 m of water close to the southern side of the entrance, but the rest of the entrance is little more than 1.5m deep.
Once in the bay, the depth increases to 6m. The head of the bay is good holding and provides shelter from most winds if close to shore in the north-west corner.
Care should be exercised when laying anchors as the bottom is covered in cabbage-like seaweed. A pick anchor is recommended.
The anchor should be sharply jerked once laid to ensure it immediately bites down through the weed into the sand, otherwise it will slide and become fouled by weed. 
feedback from other users also indicates that the cabbage may be bad but the silt/clay bottom is worse, it tends to suck heavy anchors down and can make retrieval extremely hard

Te Rua Bay
-41.2650, 174.1200
Although the bay gets wash from outgoing ferries, Yellowton Bay on the north eastern side is an excellent anchorage with shelter from all but the infrequent south westerly winds.
However, it is not very practical to run a stern line ashore because of the lack of depth close to shore.
The bay to the south west side is sheltered from southerly and south easterly winds and ferry wash but is very shallow.
Two telephone cables run across the bay from the south west bay so it is necessary to anchor here with caution.   
A depth of 2 metres can be found in the channel leading to the bay if close to the SW shore. This bay is not really suitable for vessels drawing more than 1 metre.
The head of the bay misses almost all of the ferry wash but collects the prevailing westerly to northerly winds.
A line of macrocarpa trees shelters the sides of the bay from southerly winds but these can blast out through the gap in the trees with some intensity.
The beach dries 15 metres from high water mark and then falls away to a depth of 4 metres.
There is a sand bank in the centre of this bay with little more than 1 metre of water at spring low tides, especially on the southern side.
The head of the bay can be quite weedy.

There are outlying rocks from both of these points. The reef off Scott Point is particularly dangerous as there is a sunken rock out from a visible rock; a clearance of 100 metres is suggested. There are also dangerous rocks off Marine Head and 100 metres off the northern entrance to Tawa Bay. A sunken reef off the point between Deep Bay and Pukekoikoi should be given a wide berth.
NW to N winds are accelerated through the main part of the bay and often create here a short white-capped sea when it is calm elsewhere. The force of this wind is diminished once eastwards of a line from Marine Head to Edgecombe Point.

A stern line should be used and the boat pulled back as close to the steeply shoaling north-western shore as draft will allow. 
Do not go too near to the beach across the head of the bay as it is shallow.
The remaining small coves on the western side of Tawa Bay are sheltered if a stern line is used and the boat pulled close to the shore.

Resolution Bay
 -41.0967, 174.2206
Completely open to all SE to S winds but otherwise gives good shelter.
The coves on the south-west shore do offer protection from S winds but it is difficult to get suitable anchorage because of the depth.
There is a holiday resort in the northern arm of the bay and limited stores can be obtained here.
Water is available from the wharf.
A number of large rocks below the surface are visible on the southern side of the wharf. These are over three metres below the surface and no danger to cruising boats.
A walking track leads from the holiday resort to Ship Cove. This track is through beautiful native bush. It takes about one and a half hours to walk to Ship Cove.

Blumine Island (Oruawairua)
-41.17545388, 174.23860070
This large island stands in the middle of Queen Charlotte Sound seemingly guarding it from the outer sea. The island is 295 meters high and two point three miles long from northern to southern tip. There are several shingle beaches around the whole coast and it is usually possible to find pleasant picnic spots on the leeward shores.
There is a DOC camp site on the south west side of the island. Blumine island is a DOC reserve so no dogs are allowed on the island. 
The two northern points of the island have outlying rocks and weed beds that should be given a good clearance.
There are sunken rocks extending from the shores on both sides of Patten Passage.
The reef on the northern side extends a considerable distance from the shore like a staircase down below the surface and can be a danger to boats up to 150 meters from shore.
If travelling north-east through the passage it is safest to continue on that heading until able to see most of Resolution Bay clearly past the northern end of Blumine Island before turning to the north. There is a tidal flow through the passage of up to one knot. This flows north-east until one and a half hours before HW Picton, then south-west until four hours after HW Picton.
The shoal (sandbar) extending 500 meters form the southern end of the island has sufficient depth over it for cruising boats.
The bays on the western and northern side of the island give shelter in SE winds but the holding tends to be difficult and it is very deep.
The bays on the south-east shore leading to Patten Passage give good shelter in W to NE winds. A stern line is essential because of the steeply shelving shore and to keep the boat out of wind gusts.
In SW to W winds the largest of these bays still gives shelter but the sea is pushed into it from the open sound.
The anchorage shown on the north-west side of Blumine Island is suitable for winds from N to E. There is also shelter here from NW winds but these tend to curve into the bay with a small chop. Caution should be exercised if the bay is used in anything more than moderate NW conditions.

Onahau Bay
-41.2281, 173.9875
This description relates to the wider body of water before the three bays at the head of Onahau
This bay is very attractive and has good anchorages. Cables are laid across the bottom of various parts of the bay so care must be taken when anchoring.
It is used as an access route to Kenepuru via the road over the saddle to Te Mahia.
The other unnamed bay on the east side of Onahau is very attractive but is not very suitable for overnight anchorage except in settled weather.
S sector winds blow straight in and in N sector winds it is not possible to pull into the bank out of the wind.
The north corner has a very quaint horseshoe cove, which is sheltered from all but strong NW winds.
There is little room to manoeuvre and there are some moorings.
Rocks are visible under the clear water on both sides of the entrance to the cove.
It is essential to stay in the middle of the channel.

Lochmara Bay
-41.23434589, 174.00160610
    
There are a large number of permanent and holiday homes in this bay. It is generally impractical to anchor with a stern line ashore. However, the three arms at the head of the bay all give good shelter and good holding so that swinging to one or two anchors is safe and practical.
The coves on the west side of the entrance to the bay offers some shelter in SW and S winds but otherwise are a little too open to be of any use in anything other than calm conditions. They also collect wash from ferries and the many other passing boats in Queen Charlotte Sound.
This bay is an extremely high traffic area with recreational boaties towing water skiers, biscuits etc. and people visiting Lochmara Lodge.  Caution is required. There are 5 knot speed buoys with lights located on the western side of Lochmara.

Double Cove
-41.2504, 174.0531
The whole of the Double Cove is a prohibited fishing area. There are tame fish, fed regularly, in the cove between the two main arms. The penalties for fishing for these are very high.
The eastern arm of this cove has been used as an anchorage for many years. It is safe in all-weather as little wind reaches the cove.
There are a large number of moorings along the western shore but it is usually possible to find an anchorage here with a line ashore.
There is a combined club mooring at the head of the cove, but users must always use the stern line provided to prevent swinging too close to the western jetty.
It is deep to the edge of the bank.
The western arm of this cove is more open and sunnier and as a result a little more exposed. This arm of Double Cove should not be used in southerly winds.
A power cable can be found running through this bay, with white triangles on land mark it.
There is a small sand beach, a number of private moorings, and reasonable holding.
There are two 5 knot speed buoys located in Double Cove and one at the entrance on the eastern side.
The Koi wreck is a popular diving location that lies within the no fish area.

This and Kumutoto (the rest of Double Bay) are a scenic reserve administered by the Department of Conservation. The beach consists of small golden shingle with some sand at LW. Most of the beach is covered at HW.
Kaipakirikiri is the quieter alternative to Kumutoto in the summer months. The bay is good holding and shelter in SW to W but is open to SW to S winds. In strong N sector winds it can be gusty at the head of the bay off the beach and it is quieter to anchor to the western side, with a stern line to the bank. Alternatively the cove on the west side of the bay can be a good anchorage. There is a rock in the north end of this cove near the shore.

Ski lanes can be found at the northern tip of the bay. There are 2 Combined Clubs and a CharterLink club mooring in this bay.

Kumutoto Bay (Eastern Arm of Double bay)
-41.21333938, 174.06535330
This bay is split into two arms and is very attractive, Pikupiku Bay on the north-western side is a scenic reserve and on the eastern shore there are a number of attractive holiday homes.
Pikupiku Bay features a small Department of Conservation camp area that is great for a quiet picnic among the native bush.
There is a 5 knot speed buoy as you enter the bay.
A small distance back from the shore is an old tree with many boats’ names and dates carved into it (witness of the popularity of this excellent anchorage).
The head of this arm is gusty in strong conditions and shallow along the north-eastern shore.
The beaches at the head of each arm are pleasant and consist of small golden shingle and sand.
Most of the beaches are covered at high water. There are toilets and fireplaces at the head of each arm.
The right arm has a public wharf on the western side.
There is just over one metre of water at LW alongside the wharf.
There are ski lanes marked on the beach due north of the beacon on the eastern side of the bay.
Holding is good at the head of both arms, with much the same depth and there is shelter from all N sector winds.
The cove on the western side provides excellent all weather shelter, if boats are pulled back to the shore with a stern line.
The right arm is open to S to SW winds and gives limited shelter at the head in SE winds.
The small cove south of the beacon gives best shelter in SE winds but there are wharves and jetties here and it may be difficult to get a line ashore.
Kaipapa Bay
-41.22535364, 174.07392610
This half-moon shaped bay is very exposed to winds from S to W and to the wash from outgoing ferries.
The bay offers shelter in NW to E winds but it is deep (30 metres) close to shore, which can make anchorage arduous.
There are a large number of houses on the eastern side of the bay. NW winds tend to curve into the bay with a small chop.

Golden Point at the southern tip of Kaipapa Bay was named after gold was found there. Dolphins can also often be found around this point.
There is also a nice and sandy but small beach here.

Blackwood Bay or Tahuahua Bay
-41.2383, 174.1167
This bay collects a lot of the wash from ferries and is open to most winds.
N sector winds in particular NW blow with some force off the land, making anchorage unpleasant. SE and S winds blow straight into the bay and can build up large swell. The two anchorages shown on the western side are satisfactory in SW to S to NW winds, with the most southerly bay being best in SW conditions. The wind tends to be variable in direction in these bays and a boat will move around her anchor a lot. The holding is good.
On the eastern side of the bay the anchorage shown should be used only in SE to S conditions.
North of Tunoamai Point the bay is very exposed and recommended only in settled conditions.
There are numerous jetties and moorings however there are no club moorings.

Luke Rock marked by a white beacon with a green flashing light stands at the entrance to this bay. There is deep water all around the beacon but with some weed to the NE side where the water is only two metres deep. It is possible to take boats right up to the beacon.
The bay is one and a half miles wide and tends to act as a wind funnel for both N and S sector winds. Despite this, there are several good anchorages. The bays either side of Ratimera Point provide good shelter and holding in SW to N winds but are open to winds from E to S.
The western bay is a scenic reserve. It is a little open to wind, has a beach and a ski lane called Cherry Bay. The eastern bay has little beach, except at LW, and no foreshore. It is possible to put a stern line ashore here, if required.
As shown on the sketch a line of rocks, terminating in a dangerous sunken rock, extends 60 metres south-east from the point due to north of Ratimera Point, there is an East cardinal mark on this point. The bay to the north of this reef is good holding and shelter in N sector winds but is open to S sector winds.
The northern end of Ruakaka tends to be gusty and acts as a funnel for all winds. Holding can at times be difficult. Accordingly, this area is not recommended as an over-night anchorage.
The next bay to the south, on the eastern side of Ruakaka, has many houses on its south-east shore. The north shore has a number of coves that are excellent anchorages in N sector winds but are open to the wash from outgoing ferries. A stern line is necessary, because of the small size of the coves. There are rocks, close to the shore in these coves, that should be avoided. The head of this bay misses all except SW to W winds and is generally good holding.

One of the larger bays of Inner Queen Charlotte; it is located north across the Sound from Tory Channel. The entrance is between Bull (East) Head and Snake Point and both should be given a wide berth as there are rocks off each point. The reef from Snake Point in particular extends a considerable distance below the surface and the point should be given a clearance of 150-200 metres. S winds funnel out of Tory Channel and blow straight across into Bay of Many Coves. In S gale conditions a large sea can build up in Bay of Many Coves. There is a South Cardinal mark with a light at the northern entrance and marks the reef here.

The small bays on the western side provide shelter in NW to N winds, while the two bays in the south-west end of the bay give best shelter in NW to N winds. Because there are a number of baches (holiday homes) in these bays, it is difficult to anchor with a line ashore without disturbing land owners.
The south-east end of the bay features a small cove with a house and a wharf. This cove is sheltered from all winds but is not deep close to shore. The owner’s moorings can make it difficult to anchor out of the wind.
The rest of this arm is good holding and gives reasonable shelter in winds from the S sector semi-circle. The bay shoals gently and it is best to keep at least 100 metres from the shore at the end of the bay.
Southern wharf is very exposed to N and NW wind and any ferry wash.

Waikawa Bay (Queen Charlotte Sound)
-41.2678, 174.0381
The name, Waikawa, means bitter water.1
The bay is connected by road to Picton and contains a large number of moored boats.
There is a boat yard at the southern end of the bay with a slipway and wharf. There is sufficient depth of water for most boats at the seaward ends of these wharves but they are shallow towards the shore. A trailer boat launching ramp is located in the south-eastern corner.
In the south-western end of the bay is a marina operated by Port Marlborough. It provides over 600 berths all with power and water. Toilets and adequate parking are available. Showers are available in the Waikawa Boating Club premises. There are chandlery, sail maker, dive shop, boat sales and charter companies, restaurants, marine repair shops, travel lift and trailer boat launching ramp adjacent to the marina.
The bay is open to most winds but only northerly and north-westerly winds create rough conditions at the head of the bay.
The large number of moored boats makes it difficult to anchor in a reasonable depth out of the wind.
Beeches Bay on the south-east shore is generally a more peaceful anchorage but is open to westerly to north-westerly winds.
There are boats moored in the bay but small vessels can usually find somewhere to anchor.
The rock shown off the Snout is about two metres below the surface and is 10 to 15 metres from the shore.
There are two 5 knot speed buoys located on the east side of the bay just outside the moorings.

Picton Harbour
   -41.28869 N, 174.01036 E
Waitohi/Picton is the focal point for the Queen Charlotte Sound.
It is a transport hub, connecting both North and South Island road and rail networks with ferries across Te Moana-o-Raukawa/the Cook Strait to the North Island.
The harbour is generally sheltered in most wind conditions, however, strong north-easterly and southerly winds can funnel into the Harbour and create considerable chop on the water.
There are a large number of moorings in the area of the town foreshore and care is necessary navigating here at night.
A visitors' jetty in the form of a floating pontoon extends from the Eastern end of the Picton foreshore. When space is available, it can be used by vessels of 10 meters or less seeking short term access to the town. It cannot be booked in advance and is not suitable for long term stays.
 A fee is payable for use of the wharves in Picton.

Te Weranga o Waitohi, the original name for Picton stems from wai, or water and tohi – the tohi rite. During the tohi ritual, the tohunga (priest) dipped karamu branches in a sacred stream and brushed the right shoulder of warriors before battle.
