Spearfishing tow boats are one of the best ways to be visible to boat traffic and port your catch.
Tora turned it on - glass-clear water, fat crays, and a haul of top-shelf kai. Doesn’t get much better.
First proper summer day in forever, and the Tora coast turned it on like it was getting paid.
Rolled up at 8:30 (gentleman’s hours, no 3 a.m. nonsense) just as the farmer was bringing the mob in for shearing and weaning. Gave him a wave, slogged over the paddocks, crested the hill, and nearly dropped the fins: 15 metres visibility from the beach. You could map the reefs and guts from dry land. Game on.
Hit the water and went straight for the crays. Every decent hole was packed: harem of berried girls up front, one smug buck cowering in the dark like he had a bodyguard detail. Ten metres away though, rogue males were cruising solo, antennae out, no idea they were about to become Christmas dinner. Easy pickings.
Pāua were thick; just a matter of jamming your arm into cracks and hauling out the XL black gold.
Switched to fish and the place was an aquarium—schools of baby moki, blue moki, tarakihi, the lot. Then the money shot: big red moki in pairs, gliding past, lipstick-bright, looking like they were on a date-night swim. Sat on the bottom and just watched. Magic.
The young legal moki in the weed didn’t even blink when I drifted over; could’ve tickled them under the chin. Massive blue cod in two metres of water though—one look at the flash of a fin and they were gone.
Surfaced after one dive to find the local seal already halfway through my best moki off the float. Gave the fat pirate the fright of his life when I popped up right next to him. He bolted, half a fish hanging out of his gob. Seal tax paid in full.
Loaded up, walked out, and dropped a solid kōha bag of crays and pāua with the farmer on the way past. Keeps the gate open and the yarns flowing.
Hands down one of the best dives of the year. Summer’s finally here, the BBQ’s getting a proper workout, and the esky’s stacked.
Merry Christmas, you beautiful bastards.

Spring kayak fishing off Tora’s rugged east coast delivers blue cod and seal encounters.
At 4am, the air bit at my knuckles as I strapped the kayak to the Yakima LockNLoad racks, rods tucked safely in the Topwater box. The stars were still sharp as I drove over the hill to meet Dan the farmer at 6am, his ute rumbling through the paddocks as I tagged along for access to the coast.


The double bay greeted me with a salty tang and the low growl of waves on the rocky outcrop—a natural breakwall that lets you sneak out on rowdy days. I slid the kayak into the chop, the fibreglass slicing through like a knife. Seals popped up, barking and twirling like ocean clowns, shadowing me out to 50 metres.
Then, in a heartbeat, they scattered—heads bobbing, then gone. My pulse jumped. Shark? Orca? Or just seals being seals? The water felt deeper, darker, and I paddled towards my trusty 25–30m reef, where the cod always lurk.
I dropped a soft bait to the reef’s edge, and the rod bucked hard—a 50cm blue cod, scales glinting like silver coins. Seven more followed, all 40cm-plus, with one 55cm beast that fought like it owned the sea. The swell started rolling heavier, the kayak rocking like a cradle in a storm. Fibreglass and rocks aren’t mates, so I called it—hauling eight cod back to shore.


Packing up, I dropped three fat cod as koha for Dan—his grin said it all. Back home, Tora, my furry fish detector, went nuts, tail thumping as she sniffed the catch. My daughter waved her blank book, eyes wide, ready for another page in Dad’s fishing tales. The five remaining cod became crispy blue cod tacos for the family, with a couple gifted to the in-laws.
Another Tora trip etched in memory, where the ocean’s my church and the fish are the judge. 🌮🎣

After a nice weather gap formed off the west coast, Makara was the go.
A crisp 5am launch in low single digits—it was a good frost.
The paddle out was magic, as usual.
Fog was being sucked out of the gully and rolling across the water—3 degrees in the air versus 15 degrees in the water.
As we paddled south, it was strange—just barry after barry, apart from the smallest snapper.
But as the sun came out, the barrys disappeared and the fish came on.
My mate got a nice snapper, and the kahawai were thick and big. My son already had some from the weekend, so they went back.
With wind versus tide not playing ball, we headed north to a cod spot I know—25m to 70m depth.
As we drifted down the ledge, I deployed the jig cam.
We started hauling in cod in the early 30s. After releasing a few, the larger ones came in. Reviewing the jig cam footage later, there were some nice 40 to 50cm+ ones down there.
I hooked a nice cod at 38cm, which was welcome to come home. As I was dispatching it, I had the jig bouncing around below—and it went off. On the new Catch Double Trouble 30g jig, I landed a stonker at 52cm.
Later, drifting the deeper shelves, the jig got hit. It went slack, and I thought it was a bucket mouth (aka scarpy), but then it started swimming in circles. I instantly knew what it was—my tasty friend JD (John Dory). I paddled back over the reef and saw what looked like more on the sounder. Slowly working the jig—sure enough—hooked another JD, and a good-sized one too.
All in all, it was a great day and a good paddle with the guys.
Four solid cod between 38 and 52cm, and two JDs.
To top it off, one of the locals pulled up for a chat—and offered me some crayfish.

Set out from Mana Twin Bridges for a fruitful day of fishing, targeting kingfish, snapper, and more, culminating in a surprising catch of a huge John Dory.
Hello fellow fishos.
The day started bright and early, as always. We launched from Mana Twin Bridges and headed north to Hunters in search of kingfish and snapper.
There wasn't much sign on the sounder, but we found big schools of kahawai, which also contained barracuda. We caught a few kahawai, as my son loves fresh kahawai. After losing a lot of gear to the 'barrys', I switched to a smaller 150-gram Shady Lady Long John slider (available at KP Marine) and jigged away. The jig was smashed and felt massive, so I braced for a fight. After a few mishaps and juggling the drift anchor while playing tag with the kingfish—every time it saw the boat, it would dive deep, forcing me to recover the line—I finally got it up. It was tail-hooked, which made it swim harder and feel different, but it was still a good fish.
After losing another five jigs, we moved on to catch a few snapper and kahawai closer inshore. As we headed home, the sea glassed off nicely. After a chat and calling our better halves, we got the OK to go deep to try for puka. After the first few drops yielded only scarpy, I switched to a big Harrier head and a 10-inch glow gurnard black Livie soft bait. The bait started to move so I struck, feeling loaded but dull. Thinking it was a scarpy, I didn't pay much attention until it started swimming in circles. To my surprise, it was a huge John Dory, a happy reward to end the day.
It was a very productive day with snapper, kahawai, kingfish, and John Dory.

Fishing off Waikanae Beach delivered some solid snapper and gurnard despite challenging weather and fluctuating water temperatures.
As many of you know, the northerly-southerly conditions in Wellington have been nasty lately, so when we get a window to fish, we take it.
This report covers my last trip for 2024, fishing off Waikanae Beach with a mix of boat and kayak alongside some fellow Catch ambassadors.
26th December
The day was supposed to be wind-free, but the rain was another story. I got up at 4 am, and it was absolutely bucketing down. Initially, we cancelled the trip, but then one of the crew already on the water reported that it was just drizzle on the Waikanae side. So, we packed up and headed over to set up.
Some nice snapper showed up, though I lost a very good fish on a 10-inch soft bait. Scott managed to land two nice snapper using the Deep V Catch jigs. By the end of the session, we had four good snapper and two kahawai in the bin before heading home. I filleted the kahawai, vacuum-sealed the backbones, and packed them for my son to take north.
A Few Days Later
The conditions were perfect again at Waikanae, with calm swells, so I chose the kayak and got out early.
While paddling out, I struggled to find snapper due to the southerly dropping the water temperature to 12°C. Instead, I came across gurnard—always a nice surprise. It was a great experience watching the sounder and seeing the jig going down to meet the fish.
After a few hours of drifting over the sands with Jonathan, we decided to head in before the current change carried us too far south.
All in all, a couple of great trips to cap off the year despite the challenging conditions.

The author with a solid Wellington snapper
Despite unpredictable weather Wellington fishos are enjoying rewarding fishing trips, and catching a variety of species.
If you're from Wellington, you know what this time of year is like, with the northerly giving way to a brief two-hour break before the southerly kicks in, back and forth. So, we get out when we can on any coast.
It's been school holidays, and we made the most of it. We had a small window to dive fish one Saturday in early September; visibility was average, and the crays were still in berry. As we drifted and caught the odd kahawai, my rod bent over while I was working a Catch Black Label Livie Shady Lady. To my surprise, a nice healthy snapper surfaced, energizing everyone, and all rods were deployed.
When my son arrived from Australia, we went for a surf cast over the Kapiti Coast where I was out-fished by my son, who loved the kahawai running. A few days later, my son joined me to fish the wharves around inner Wellington Harbour, where he caught small gurnard and cods. After finishing work on the tugs, we went for a few more casts. Four hours later, we had six kahawai and a lovely 42cm cod, which is my son's new personal best—a good catch for the inner harbour off the wharf at Queens. I love the vibrant blues and greens of the big cods, caught using the Shady Lady Mini Squidwing.
A few weeks later, we went on our New Zealand school holidays up north to our family land. Walking the driftwood beaches and casting for kahawai was fun. Even my dad caught some, which was cool—three generations flicking lures, using Catch Fishing Micro Pocket Rockets, Micro Boss, and Mini Squid Wings.
I'm really looking forward to a good day out fishing. Stay positive, and the weather will slowly improve.

A good Winter haul of Wellington blue cod
Big winter blue cod - The Storm Petrel turns on a dynamic day of crayfish and blue cod.
The winter waters are delivering the goods, with the colder currents and chilly mornings making for some exciting catches. A typical day out on the Storm Petrel involves alternating between diving and fishing, then a break for lunch.
We launched early at Mana and headed south to our dive spot. The divers enjoyed the clear blue water and collected some winter bucks.


I drifted over a reef, catching only parrot fish and Jock Stewarts. I was using a 7" Catch Livie Power Pilchard with a 56-gram Harrier head and an assist hook (since 90% of the hookups are on the tail), paired with 12lb Tasline PE1 on the IRT300RT reel and a Kensai spin slow pitch rod.
As I drifted in 60m, I noticed a slight rise on the bottom. Working the soft bait with the cod twitch, it suddenly went slack on the fall, and I knew I had one. Bang—hook in! As I started to retrieve, I had to back off the drag since I was fishing PE1. When I saw it coming up the water column, I could tell it was a big blue cod. I got really excited and scrambled to find the net, which was still in the hold—always better to set up for the fight beforehand, e.g., net out, GoPro up and recording.


I opted to leader land, which haunts me as I had snapped the line on another huge cod last time I did this. Luckily, I landed it and let out a shout of joy, relieved that it was safe and well within legal size.


As I continued fishing, catching more cod, I decided to measure a few and realised I was throwing back legal ones because they looked so small compared to the big cod. When the divers returned, they had a heap of crays and kina, and during the second dive, more blue cod were caught.

Encounter with a large thresher shark and good kahawai fishing near Kapiti Island.
Our day starts early on the dive boat as we head north from Plimmerton to Kapiti Island, conducting a quick reconnaissance over Hunter's Reef but with no sign of activity. However, there were heaps of kahawai visible on the surface. We trolled and cast for kahawai to load up, as the boat owner particularly loves kahawai, which he refers to as "Steak."
As Pete and Shayne dived in, I knew I had about 40 minutes to fish, so I drifted around close by and spotted a good mid-water mark (unbeknownst to me, it was a thresher). I cast the paua power back and let it sink, then worked the jig.
About the sixth jerk, the jig got smashed, and it was go-time. I didn't know what it was, but it was powerful and fast. Watching the line spool off, I thought, "Damn, that's like 300m gone; got to chase it." I started the engine and turned to chase the fish to regain the line. Damn, it was fighting hard. As I tightened the drag on the new IRT 800DD to try to stop it, the fish kept surging on.
This was a big thresher; it jumped out about four times. I knew I was in trouble as it was about 4m long, mostly tail, but damn, those tails flick. I found out during one jump/breach close to the boat when it tried to slap me.
This tug of war went on for about 23 minutes at 70% drag on the new reel. When I heard the scuba whistle, I knew I had to get this fish in or lose the battle. I tightened up the drag again and dug in, but either the assist or the hook snapped, and I lost the fight. But wow, what a rush—23 minutes of 70% drag and a tug of war to retrieve the line while driving the boat.
All in all, the Tasline is amazing; the new IRT 800 DD (double drag), with 37 kgs of drag, held up, and my arms were a little longer. Great fun.
Afterwards, I picked up the divers and then we went and got some easy fish. It was a great day on the water on the Storm Petrel—good banter and good food.

Surf fishing for kahawai - Wainuiomata coast
Fishing report for Wellington / Kapiti supplied by Jason Grimmet on Friday the 12th of April 2024
Morena from Wellington
Over the last few weeks, the kahawai have been running hard along the coasts. My son, who is over from Australia for the school holidays, and I chose to head to the Wainuiomata coast to flick lures for kahawai.
Upon arrival, the water was teeming with kahawai, swimming in and out of the swells and the fresh saltwater flows. After experimenting with a few lure changes, we discovered the size and colour they preferred. It was an action-packed morning on day one, with heaps of fish—nearly every cast resulted in a hookup.


As our bin began to fill, we started to behead and gut the fish before placing them in a saltwater bucket. We ended up with around 26 kahawai, which we distributed throughout our community. We continued fishing and handed them out to fellow fishermen and families. One gentleman wasn’t having much luck, so while he continued fishing, my son and I filled his bucket with 12 fish. Seeing him return and the smile on his face was a highlight of the day.
The new Catch Black Label Livies pk 4 x 7" Jerkshad Neho's Nemesis lures worked a treat on the kahawai. All in all, we distributed a heap of kahawai and caught even more for other families.

An early start on a new spot led to a rewarding day on the water, culminating in a couple of notable snapper catches.
The day started early to beat the Easter holiday rush onto the water.
We started out deep but only found sea perch, which I kept as they were of a good size.
Moving into shallower waters (30m), we targeted snapper. At a newly discovered spot, we anchored, set the berley, and fed the baby blue cod for a while before the snapper arrived. They came in slowly, the smaller ones first. As they gradually increased in size, my son caught a nice few snapper and was thrilled until Shayne landed a solid 91cm snapper, which we released. A few kahawai also came in and were brought home for dinner.
I had a sizeable bait soaking, but it only seemed to attract carpet sharks and a huge 2m conger eel. I’ve been trying a new type of snapper rig, similar to a John Dory rig but larger, and it has been producing some nice fish too. I cast the double trouble paua power 200-gram out the back to work the area back to the boat.
After the third cast, I got a hit and, my, did it hit and run. I decided to try the new reel’s dual drag (30kgs), tightened it up a little, and began the fight. The reel and rod worked well together, and the Tasline held up nicely, spooling on silky smooth to the reel.
I rose to the top of the gunnel to fight and land the fish solo, as everyone else was busy removing fish or unhooking sharks. The snapper was 82cm and bloated, so it was taken home to feed some families. Interestingly, the snapper had what looked like a healed spear injury, with the scales around it being particularly tough.

Sunday 'funday' misson off Makara beach.
After a week of mixed of northerly and southerly winds, formulating a fishing plan proved challenging. The east coast was experiencing a 2-knot current, but it was accompanied by a 1.6 to 2-meter swell rolling straight in from the east. So, after much discussion in our kayak group to plan a trip, we decided to give Tora a miss and head to Makara Beach instead.
We planned to launch at 7 am as the sun rose. Myself, along with four other kayakers, met and prepared for the day. The plan was to paddle north, jigging for kingfish and snapper all the way past Boom Rock, then let the current carry us south for the return journey.
With only juvenile 'ratty' kings, ranging from 50cm to 70ish, occupying our time, we decided to venture out deeper in search of snapper and cod. After landing a few larger kahawai and small cod, I located the snapper and cod.
There’s nothing quite like spotting the fish, dropping a jig, and watching it work, seeing the fish move towards it. The other guys caught kings, snapper, blue cod, and trevally.
The tide turned, and we began our drift south from past Boom Rock, around the 60-70m mark. The jig I mainly used was the Boss Squid Lumo, Deep V, Double Trouble.
I still hadn't had a decent fish on the new combo – the IRT800 on the Catch Spin Jig 150-gram.


As I drifted, I noticed some promising signs and dropped the Ninja Double Trouble down, slowly working the jig. The fish approached (it's fantastic when it's so clear you can see the jig and fish moving). A quick little redrop of a few meters, then adjust the drag, flip the bail arm over, and watch it load up. Boom – a good fish on.
It had me puzzled at first as to what it was. It made powerful runs, but as soon as it started to go in circles, I had a hunch it was a trevally. As I smoothly landed the fish, thoughts of the ceviche my wife makes with home-grown herbs and tomatoes came to mind – absolutely delicious.
Back home, I filleted the fish. My daughters enjoyed homemade chips and tempura snapper, while we indulged in tempura Bluff oysters followed by the ceviche.

With a brief calm in the weather, a kayak fishing trip off Makara yielded a solid haul of snapper and blue cod.
After weeks of battling La Niña winds and north-westerlies with brief southerly changes, I seized a calm window early Wednesday morning.
Despite a blocked river mouth at Makara forcing a beach launch, I was on the water by 5am, paddling through mist that formed as the day warmed. Initially distracted by a large school of kahawai and English mackerel, I moved on to target blue cod, securing a few good 43cm catches before aiming for kingfish.


Although the kingfish were elusive, dropping a paua power jig behind the reef rewarded me with snapper instead. Paddling back against the wind in 8 to 10m of water, the clear visibility revealed blue cod attacking the jig and schools of moki and butterfish.
I returned with 4 snapper and 3 blue cod, much to my youngest's delight, who always looks forward to seeing what I bring home. The new paua power slow pitch jig, with its solid lumo band, and the strength of the tasline continue to impress.

An early start for a successful kayak day. Includes speeds comparo between pedal and arm-powered yaks.
Our fishing adventure began at 2 am, heading to Tora on the east coast, with my son entertained by my possum-dodging driving. Arriving at 4:30 am, he set up on the beach but was chased away by seals, while I prepared the kayak for a 5 am launch with my friend Greg from GP Fishing Adventures.


Early morning start.
We launched through a 2-meter swell, heading out to the 50m to 100m ledge, and continued north, surrounded by whales and dolphins. I used my usual spin SPj setup - the Catch Kensai with the IRT 300 reel loaded with Tasline 40lb and the Paua Power Double Trouble. Despite our efforts spin-jigging the ledge, we only caught kahawai, mackerel, and jock stewarts, and even after splitting up to try different spots, including a 100 to 300m ledge, we had little success.


I then decided to head into a bank with good signs. Here, I caught six kingfish, keeping two, and returned to shore not wanting to stay out too long as my son was on the beach. He greeted me with a huge smile, having caught three crayfish and five paua in knee-deep water. We offered our koha to the landowner - a whole kingfish and two crays.

This Wellington report covers a successful day out with Blackpearl Fishing Charters catching kingfish and snapper plus a teaser for a beast of a trumpeter.
I booked a fishing charter with Blackpearl Fishing Charters  as a Christmas present for my sons, aiming to get them onto some fish. We left Mana Marina and decided to head out for a jig for kingfish.
Upon arriving at the location, my son Mike hooked a kingfish on the first drop, which was just legal size and was released. We reset the drift, and I watched my sons try jigging for the first time, coaching them on the technique. I then decided to try out the Catch #pauapower double trouble 200-gram jig on a 7000 reel loaded with 80lb Tasline. On the second deployment, I was hit hard on the way down and reeled in a nice 106cm kingfish.


We decided to keep it as it was a good size to share. As my sons continued fishing, I offered to hook a fish and hand over the rod to them, which they eagerly accepted. Meanwhile, Jules landed a legal-sized fish but released it, and Scott hooked a good-sized fish but lost it. I managed to hook another, which I handed over to Lukah James, who thoroughly enjoyed the fight. Lukah also caught a nice snapper on a 350-gram jig, which we kept.


As our time came to an end, Jules's line screamed off with the last kingfish of the day. Overall, it was a great day out on the Blackpearl, based out of Mana in Wellington. I highly recommend them for all fishing adventures, whether targeting snapper, kingfish, hapuku, tuna, or other species. The skipper lets you choose your target and plan your trip, making for an amazing experience on a fantastic boat.


If you get a chance, give Blackpearl Fishing Charters a try. They are a super professional outfit.


Giant Trumpeter


"We ventured out to the West Coast, targeting kingfish and trumpeter off Jackson Bay with Catch jigs. Captain Nick, Ollie, Will, and I found a promising spot at a 100m pin."
"Despite a few strong hits, nothing hooked initially. We then decided to try a live bait, and on the second drop, we got a solid hit.
"While I was battling seasickness due to the rough conditions, Will was busy reeling in a tough catch.
"The fight was intense at the bottom, but once our 7000 lifted it off the seabed, it became a dead weight. The fish made several strong runs before breaking the surface, revealing its impressive size – a 15.8kg beauty, measured with guts out."

Deep sea slow pitch jigging session leads to trumpeter in Wellington waters
Hi Team,
I couldn't make it out fishing myself, but I've been busy chatting and helping at the expo.
On Saturday morning, I attended KP Marine's expo, which was a fantastic event featuring insightful talks and displays from various suppliers. Espresso's soft bait talk was particularly impressive, as were the presentations from Ocean Legacy on slow pitch jigging, and MIG and Scott from Fishing Adventure. Unfortunately, I had to leave early due to an unexpected job on the tug boat.
Many attendees who bought new gear and learned new techniques at the expo went out fishing that afternoon, reporting catches of snapper, kingfish, and tarakihi.
Solid puka
Although Wednesday's forecast was promising, I had to change my plans due to my wife's flight being cancelled. However, I had a great chat with Sam from Sam Sea's Salt (https://instagram.com/sam_seas_salt?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==), who took the Shimano representative and Felix from Capital Fishing (https://instagram.com/capital.fishing?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==) out for a deep sea slow pitch jigging session. From their feed and photos, it seems they had a great time catching various species, and it's exciting to see trumpeter back in our waters.

A successful day of fishing in Wellington, with notable catches including decent snapper and small puka, using a variety of techniques including electric reels and jigging.
With the forecast looking promising, we hit the water early, but by 6:30 am, many others had the same idea. The weather was expected to be a 2-knot wind, shifting to a 5-knot northerly in the afternoon. While the guys dived for crayfish, I stayed close, watching and flicking lures as I drifted, catching just perch and small cod. After retrieving the divers, we headed to spot 2 and decided to check out my puka spot, which I usually hit with the kayak.
Good haul of crays
I set up the electric reels and gear for the others and baited up. We set up the drift and dropped the electric reels. Once they hit the bottom, I grabbed my spin slow pitch setup (Catch Kensia slow pitch rod and a Catch/IRT 300 reel) with 40lb Tasline spooled on. I chose a 100-gram Catch Squid boss lumo (my current favourite jig) and dropped it. Watching the sounder as we descended the side of the drop-off, I saw good signs and told the guys to watch the rods as I jigged.
I got a hit and had a good little scrap on the 'little rod', as they call it, and up floated a nice pup puka. As we came to the top, I dropped again but this time with the new paua power jig from Catch. It got hit a few seconds after hitting the bottom. It screamed off, and in 100m depth, I was intrigued. After a tug of war, we finally saw colour about 25 meters down and knew it was a good snapper, 75cm. As it floated up, it was amazing. I did two more drops and caught two more snappers of about the same size.
Pup-sised puka on Catch squid boss
Many of the other guys I talked to at the ramp were catching kahawai, small snapper, and the odd bycatch.
It was a great day on the water, enjoyed by all.

This Wellington / Kaipiti reports a promising fishing scene with bluefin tuna, snapper, sizeable gurnard, and schools of kahawai, alongside notable kingfish sightings near Kapiti Island, setting the stage for an exciting weekend ahead.
Good afternoon from the lower North Island.
It's been an intriguing few weeks, with bluefin tuna spotted off Days Bay Wharf and snapper appearing.
(Update from the Editor: We've now been sent the video by angler Fletcher Tornquist. You can view it here: Bluefin tuna hooked from Wellington wharf 😃)
This weekend promises excellent conditions out west.
Snapper are showing up in significant numbers north of Kapiti Island and are gradually moving down the coast, with a few also in Wellington Harbour.


There's an abundance of sizeable gurnard being caught across the region. Enormous schools of kahawai are gathering as the whitebait and krill migrate.


Notably, some fine kingfish have been sighted around Kapiti Island and the Hunters and Boom Rock reefs. The fishing has been superb, and we're eagerly anticipating the weekend.

A summarised transcript of the above interview discussion and fishing report from Pete Lamb
“Living in Kapiti most of the time, I've noticed some excellent beach fishing around the Kapiti coast.”
“The fishing here has significantly improved in the last few years. From being almost barren about five years ago, it's now prime snapper territory. Even during the winter, which was previously unheard of, we're catching snapper off the shore. Just a couple of weeks ago a mate of mine caught five in one night before I got mine and lost five, in early September, which is astonishing.
“As a result, the industry has seen growth. We're selling more surfcasting gear and introducing more people to the sport. We're also helping them upgrade their equipment and teaching them new techniques. I've been conducting surfcasting charters, aiming to help people catch their first snapper.
“For bookings, people can visit our website or simply call or text us.
“Nowadays, especially during the winter, there's an expectation of catching snapper, which wasn't the case before.
“They're now present all year round. While they might be a bit more elusive in the winter than in the summer, there are still some sizable catches. Additionally, there seems to be an increase in trevally and large blue mackerel. Often, when we're boat fishing, we catch more of these large blues than kahawai.
“On the south coast, catches of blue cod and terakihi are consistent. On the west coast, it's more varied, with colder water species like warehou and blue mackerel becoming more prevalent.
“Kingfish haven't been as abundant in the last couple of years. We do a lot of inshore fishing around Mana and down to Makara. While we used to catch a lot of kingfish, they've been scarce recently. However, Kapiti offers a different experience. It's warmer, less windy, and there's an abundance of snapper and kingfish. Softbaits and slowjigs work exceptionally well in Kapiti.
“We're approaching the season when kingfish start moving into the harbour. Shore fishermen have been using the slide baiting technique with great success, especially in places like Oriental Bay. This method has revolutionised kingfish fishing, especially around the harbour. With the current nor‘westerlies, I anticipate the water will warm up soon, making it ideal for fishing.
“The weather forecast suggests calm conditions on the south coast for the next couple of days, followed by southerlies over the weekend. This should make the west coast fishable. There are still a few puka around, but many have migrated to spawning grounds. Deep water fishing in the trench has yielded blue nose, bass, and puka. The trench is a popular spot due to its potential for big catches.
“North Westerlies often make the West Coast challenging for fishing. However, when conditions are calm, the fishing is excellent.
“Another surfcasting hotspot in Wellington is Palliser Bay. The number of snapper here is remarkable. We're also expecting a significant influx of moki soon.
“Palliser Bay offers consistent fishing, making it ideal for both new and experienced anglers. I'm planning to head over in the next few days, hoping to catch some early season moki

It’s pretty typical at this time of year for the fishing gear to stay tucked away in the corner.
Water temps are down as low as 12 degrees, so that has a real impact on the metabolism rates of the fish, and it can take a lot of patience, a good berly trail, or just some good luck to get a decent catch in the bin.
Having said that, the puka fishing is not too bad out wide, and targeting the deeper water in general is turning up some very nice snapper, trevs, teri’s and the odd good kingy.
If you’re in the right place at the right time, the odd winter moocher snaps can be picked up.  We got a pretty nice fish around fifteen pound off Makara right on turn of the tide the other day, even though the going was mostly slow otherwise.
Surf casting is still a good option when the wind drops and the water is reasonably clear, with most of the popular species still on the cards, although nothing like the young guys I talked to recently who managed a bluefin tuna off the rocks on a popper up at Lottin Point.  What an amazing experience that must have been.
Land based squid fishing is still productive in the harbour, with jigs working well under the lights or around quiet areas where there is a lot of weed and not too much current.
Hunter’s Bank and Fisherman’s Rock are turning up a few good warehou, which are an awesome winter catch, as well as some big winter teris’ and trevs.  It’s a good time of the year to be targeting the 60 – 100 metre zone, when the weather allows there’s all sorts of action that you can find lurking around the foul.
It’s not too far away from spring now, and as the days slowly get a bit longer so does the inclination to get out and give it a crack.

There’s been heaps of fishing happening. Surf casting wise, Palliser Bay remains the hot spot, with good catches of trevally, gurnard, snapper, and a few stray moki.
In particular, there is some really good snapper fishing still happening, with plenty of fish up to 15 pounds caught over the last week.
The water has been nice and clean, not too much swell, and that makes it ideal for land based anglers.
Ocean Beach has been firing, and when it’s not, the action has usually swung more east of Lake Ferry.
There’s no real tide action that seems to work best consistently, the one thing that does make a difference though, is fishing the clearer water. It’s great to fish through the tidal change, as you get two different tidal flows and you’re never sure exactly which one will fire up the bite on the day.
With a lot of rain often the dirty water spills out into the ocean, such as at Lake Ferry, and you’ll notice the current takes it either east or west.  Whatever side it’s going, make sure you fish in the clear side or where you can see the water colour change away from the dirtier flow.
Boaties are enjoying a lot of good snapper, puka and kingfish action, all from around the local reefs and popular hotspots around Kapiti.
Mana is proving a little harder to find decent snapper but they are still there for the patient.
There’s been a good run of blue warehou, which are a great fun fish to catch, really aggressive and pretty good to eat.
Warehou can be found around most reef areas at the moment, pretty much anywhere you can catch terakihi. The bigger the reef the better it is, the more tide the better, like Hunters, Karori Light etc.
They are really aggressive biters and you’ll get them on jigs, like slow pitch or smaller kingie jigs as well as normal baits.
You’ll get them well up off the bottom, so keep you jig moving if you get on to them.  They are a regular feature every year around this time, and can be great fun to target.
Good sized hapuka have reported back to us from anglers just off the back of Mana and off Makara, along with a few larger sized kings.
The terakihi fishing has been awesome out a bit deeper, like 80 metres off Mana
This year we seem to have had a lot more squid turn up, which is great for the fishing generally, attracting nice big predators, but also for fishermen targeting these mobile calamari units.
There’s a lot of squid fishing around the wharves under lights using squid jigs at the moment.  Winter is their season.  You can get plenty of squid during the day too, if you target weedy areas where there is little tidal flow.

 The current fishing conditions in the Wellington region have been somewhat patchy, in line with the weather patterns, and winds making the waters pretty murky at times. However, when it has been fishable, there have been some good catches reported, particularly of snapper.

The current fishing conditions in the Wellington region have been somewhat patchy, in line with the weather patterns, and winds making the waters pretty murky at times. However, when it has been fishable, there have been some good catches reported, particularly of snapper.
Interestingly, the pattern of the snapper population seems to be changing for the better, with solid fishing all year round now.
This is seen as a very positive change, as snapper is quite a dominant species, and seeing them flourish around all our coastlines is certainly welcome.
The west coast fishing has also been reported as good, with some nice catches of snapper off the shore, and from boats fishing the popular reef haunts around Makara etc.
The fishing conditions have improved over the last month, with good snapper being caught all through Palliser Bay.
Some impressive catches have been reported, with fish up to five or six kilos. There have also been a couple of larger catches reported, up to 10 kilos even.
Off the shore, fishing has been going really well particularly off the south coast and Palliser Bay.  There’s been good moki fishing and plenty of solid snaps and trevs being landed.
On the kingy front, it’s a bit quiet but this is not too unexpected for coming in to winter.


The really big news is bluefin fishing.  With a dozen or more fish being landed bluefin fever is on.
These amazing gamefish have been captured off Cape Palliser, trolling around the thousand-meter mark generally, and quite a few boats are now heading out when the conditions allow.
Bluefin can be pretty aggressive, and you don’t need a full-on game-setup to be in the hunt, a couple of good lures trolled with solid gear and you are good to give it a go.
I reckon we are seeing the effect of the commercial and recreational set nets restrictions off the west coast of the North Island since October 2020, which might have impacted the quantity and variety of fish coming in close to shore.
See more here:
 
In Wellington region, for instance, I really reckon there has been an uptake in productive in-shore boat fishing, with fishers reporting catches of better and better snapper amidst the tarakihi and Cod.
I’m just speculating, but it’s good to see improvement whatever the reason.
The harbour is still fishing pretty solid, gurnard, snapper, trevs all in decent numbers right through the harbour reef systems.
Out wide, it’s bluenose and puka season coming up, but this is one area where the fishing has been a bit tougher lately, from our reports anyway.
A few puka have been caught in the South Coast area, although not in substantial numbers.
In case you have not caught up, there is anew regulation on hapuku/bass fishing, with a limit now of two fish per person. Full details HERE:
We’re still seeing a few fish out of the Trench, but nothing spectacular to report.
 
Changeable, typical winter conditions, means you take your opportunities where you can, but overall, the Wellington region seems to be experiencing an exciting time for fishing, with some positive changes in local fish populations that promise good fishing opportunities in the future.

For a start, surfcasting-wise, this year seems to have seen a massive number of really decent sized fish landed up Tehoro Otaki way.
It’s not firing all the time of course, but when the water is nice and clear, particularly around high tide after dark, I know of half a dozen fish over the magic twenty-pound mark having been landed from the shore just in the last couple of weeks.
For consistency, the harbour seems to be better for snapper though, and the latest hot spot that really seems to have fired over the last week or so, is Seatoun wharf, and along the beach there.
More commonly known for gurnard and red cod, this stretch has lately turned up some really decent snaps.
Snapper fishing on the whole is just getting better and better as the years progress in Welly, with good fishing in the Lambton harbour, Eastbourne, and Even’s Bay.
Perhaps it’s the global warming, fisheries management, or whatever other factors that have turned the tide, but whatever is responsible it’s meant snapper are on the menu more and more each season.
This time of the year the Eastbourne side really starts to come on with good snapper, and even better kingfish action.
Sunshine Bay has been a real slide-baiting hotspot, with really good sized fish landed, and some real hogs wrecking gear and busting off a few fisho’s.
Boaties fishing at the Wreck ( Between Mahanga Bay and Somes Island )have been enjoying great catches of snapper, gurnard, trevs, terakihi and of course good kingies that like to hang around the structure.
Live baiting around this feature has resulted in some nice fish landed and a few big bust offs.
Ward Island is also fishing well too, so it’s nice to know there are so many sheltered options in the harbour when the rough stuff arrives from up north.
Off the south coast, the big Palliser Bay moki run never really wound up big time this year, but as a good consolation, the snapper fishing has been absolutely outstanding, if not the best we’ve seen in a long time.
If you know what you’re doing, or just get lucky, it’s not uncommon to see five or six snapper in a session from the shore, and naturally some great results off the boat, even though it can get a bit gnarly out there.
Tuna, mostly albacore but a few skippies too, are plentiful out wide, and you never know what else can turn up out there from broadbill to bluefin.
The west coast is super warm now, and good fishing for pretty much everything.
Albies off Mana and Kapiti, all the west coast reef structures producing snapper, teri’s etc.
Puka fishing is on and off, but you’re generally going to get a good feed of bottom fish if out deep at the turn of the tide does not produce.
Next week or so looks pretty good weather-wise, so it could pay to get in before the cyclone turns up from up north around Wednesday.
Kapiti is certainly fishing well for the usual species, and a lot of boaties are binning a feed, then heading out a little bit deeper off the north end and grabbing a few albacore.
Nothing wrong with the snapper -tuna combo, and as long as water condition continues to be clear and blue this should be a good option for a successful day trip.
Remember to keep an eye on the forecast, stay safe, good luck, tight lines.

Summer arrives with a bang, and the fishing has been as good as the weather.


We’ve been pretty much out very day recently, and the snapper fishing has been amazing.
We thought last year was the best we’ve seen for a long, long time in Wellington, but so far this season seems to be shaping up even better.
We were throwing back as many legal fish as we were keeping, snapper were everywhere we tried in decent numbers, so it’s very encouraging knowing that there’s a good chance of picking up some good action any time you head out.
Some fish have been really good size too, and I think we broke the 20 lb mark with one fish off the back of Mana.
As well as snaps, we’ve caught john dory, puka, and the usual terries and cod quite easily off the west coast – Pukerua Bay, Plimmerton, South of Mana and down to Boom Rock, it’s been all go.
Ohau, Hunters, and Fisherman’s are all fishing really good during the right tide movements and we are flat out supplying bait and berley to the local stores, so there are plenty of boats out there reaping the rewards.
Just in the last few days there have been some particularly good surf casting snapper catches, including 10 plus kilo fish off Tehoro.
Surfcasters have been doing well on the snapper at Palliser Bay, and picking up a few moki too, but there has been better moki fishing at Long Beach.  
Conditions are primo and that makes the fishing pretty pleasurable and productive.  There’s more snapper close in than we have experienced for years now, so it’s worth putting in the extra effort to getting to good spots early, investing in decent bait and gear, fishing into the night etc.  
Effort in is often rewarded with a good feed at this time.
With a dead mahi mahi washed up on the Kapiti coast this week, it’s not surprising that there are also a few good albacore tuna now being landed, both off the back of Mana and out back of Kapiti.
We have heard rumors that there have also been a couple of bluefin in amongst, which would not be at all surprising, the water is in beautiful condition out there at the moment.
About the only species that has not really fired up for us recently, are the kingies.
Although we often don’t specifically target kingies, we do fish a lot of live bait, and usually pick up far more as bycatch than we have over the last few weeks.
Obviously, there are still whoppers around, and really targeting kings is often required to get best results around the usual haunts of Hunters, Kapiti and Boom etc.
It’s not been too bad out at the Trench, no real red-hot action to report but some solid bluenose have been landed really deep.
That about wraps it up for the year for us.  I hope you’ve enjoyed the reports again this year, and we look forward to seeing you in the shop if you ever want to have a chat or know a bit more about what’s happening on the day.
Take care, stay safe, and have a great Christmas

Wellington Fishing going well heading into summer.
Nice Warehou off Boom Rock area
Just in time for summer, the snapper seem to have really turned up now, with plenty of fish around Makara, and snapper galore off Mana.
The usual story with snaps, lots of pannies, a few good mid-sized specimens, and the odd thumper in the mix.
The fishing has been going well generally, with some good light winds of late making all coasts fishable, and even better when the water is clear.  This is particularly good for the moki fishing.
Shore based anglers can expect plenty of snapper, moki and a few gurnard and trevs in most popular locations.
Palliser Bay and Lake Ferry are fishing well now, so with the right moon and tide conditions anything is on.
Whangamoana, The Spit and Ocean beach have all been producing good numbers of fish.
On the west coast, dodge the seals around Red Rocks and get into some moki, particularly on the high tide.
A few snapper and gurnard are getting caught around Evans Bay with the odd kingi landed as well.
The Kapiti coast is providing some good snapper when conditions allow as well.
Raumati, Paikakariki, Tehoro and northwards have all been producing good snapper for surfcasters mainly after dark.
Kapiti continues to fish really well as we reported last week.  Snapper, kingfish, terakihi etc, it’s all on when the conditions allow you to get out there.
Mana has been great for snapper mostly, but the fishing can be a bit more inconsistent so you may have to be patient and wait out bite times as the tides move about.
We did have a 40-50lb kingi around the boat the other day and caught a couple of decent fish on recent trips.
Some nice puka are getting caught around Makara and back of Mana so it can be worth diving out a bit deeper once you’ve fished the reefs with the current running, to grab the slack tide for deep dropping.
The Trench has been producing bluenose and gemfish, including some good sized fish off the far side in around 300 metres recently.
Snapper, trevally and gurnard have been easy to catch around Ward Island, Point Gordon and Falcon Shoal.
Anglers are hoping the bluefin will turn up again out behind Kapiti, as there have been some reasonable albacore caught and sighted over the last couple of weks.
If you like warehou, we’ve caught plenty from the boat off Boom Rock, and some good sized ones to boot.

Fishing Report Wellington 18th November.
A great run of settled weather has really given Wellington Fisho’s a good opportunity to get out there and into it, with some excellent fishing off every coast.
I’ve been out quite a bit, done a few charters and enjoyed some good results across the board.
Land based and surf casting has been great with clearer water and pleasant conditions.
The moki 1000 fishing comp went well last weekend at Ngawai, with a fair number of fish caught, the largest going 4.3 kilos.
Over Palliser Bay way the moki fishing has generally been pretty good, and there’s also been plenty of snapper caught too, but the season is early and we expect this to only get better as we get closer to December.
It’s been very fishable off south and west coast, a little dirty water at times but mostly pretty good, and snapper fishing north towards Kapiti has been particularly nice, my mate landing a nice 7 kilo fish north of Te Horo.
By boat, Kapiti is the place to be fishing, with recent reports from there anglers doing really well on snapper, trevs and gurnard off all the fishable reef systems out there.  Good weather has really made this a top destination and warm water, around 18 plus degrees, has ramped up the bite.
Kapiti tends to be fishing better than Mana, which we have found a bit patchy on snapper.
Makara is producing good fish, and a spearo shot a 10-kilo fish here last week.
A few nice puka turning up out wide off the west coast, with the odd 20 kilo fish in the mix.  
I don’t get out to the Trench that often nowadays, but I was pleased to make it out with a couple of mates for some great fishing, topped off by around a 25 kilo bluenose hauled up from 280 metres in our favourite bass patch.
There’s good kingies and gemfish in a bit shallower too.
Out at Hunters the water was so clear kingfish were chasing jigs to the boat but not taking them, which can sometimes happen when the conditions are too good!
There’s been a good run of john dory, and some big ones, which are naturally a fantastic table fish and always welcome on board.
You’ll pull these fish out of any shallower areas of foul around all coastlines, best targeted with livies, and a great by-product can sometimes be a good kingfish or snapper.  If you’re keen on giving this a go HERES HOW:  
We got a swag of really decent one to two kilo teri’s off Boom, which is a really pleasant place to fish in some of the weather conditions we’ve been enjoying.
Make the most of it while you can

There’s been a few good days out on the boat between spring gales. Fishing is there or thereabouts what we would expect in spring, warming up nicely but not totally firing on all cylinders yet. Whitebait season was very ordinary this year, so let’s hope the other fishing makes up for it. Surf casting has been better up Kapiti way, with some nice snapper catches from Raumati and TeHoro, and further north again. Bigger fish coming commonly around five-plus kilos in nice and early so hopefully it will be a good summer for the land-based crew. There’s no shortage of other species out there too, with kahawai and gurnard often taking the baits to keep things interesting.
Drone fishing has really kicked off around the country as a ‘new’ way of getting a line out further than you can cast, and we are starting to see some really good results from using this method.
Boat fishing has turned up the normal sort of fare, cod, terakihi, trevs, kingies and snapper of course, with any of the usually productive spots all turning up a decent fish in the right conditions.
There’s still a decent number of warehou about, mostly up towards Kapiti, so you may pick up these fish likely as a bycatch.
We’ve caught a few nice hapuka out back of Mana and around the other areas you’ll usually find them
Gale force north westerly winds throw up the challenge when they kick in and can sometimes stop us getting out there for pretty long spells, which isn’t much help when you’re trying to get out wider and target puka.
They are just coming back from the spawn right now, and there’s a few nice ones turning up off Makara, South of Mana etc.  Sometimes they can be a bit skinny but there’s still a good feed on such a meaty fish.
There’s consistent catches of kingfish in the harbour now, from boat and slide baiters from the shore.
We should see more as the summer schools start to come through.
There has not been a really good run of moki yet, but they are starting to come through and I’ve picked up the odd one around the south coast at high tide.
Generally, through November and December there’s primo moki fishing so that’s something to look forward to, and a good time to stock up on cray/mussel/shellfish baits that they love so much.  
Palliser Bay and Ocean Beach are real hotspots for this action.
We do offer trips from $120 per person (including tackle, bait and transport) if you’re keen to talk to us about learning how to target these great fish.
If you do strike a run of moki, you can do really well and pick up multiple fish this time of year.
As soon as the water becomes clear and clean a is a good time to get into it, so try and keep an eye out for areas that have had enough shelter to run clear and that’s the best conditions to try for moki.
Those that have been able to get out off the south coast have been enjoying some big terakihi, some decent snapper, hoki, puka and the odd bluenose out past the hundred metre plus zone.
Snapper are being caught around the fifty metre mark, but the summer run of snaps has not really kicked in just yet.
There’s not been much else exceptional on the fishing front that I can recall lately, apart from an albacore caught off the back of Kapiti, so stay tuned as we get out there a bit more and see what happens coming into Christmas.

Spring conditions mean it’s pretty up and down with the weather, and when that cold southerly blast rocks through it’s only the keen out there. When it is good, there’s a bit of good fishing going on.
We’ve managed some fishing at Hunter’s, and although we didn’t pick up any snapper, got a swag of big teri’s and a heap of big trevs.  
It’s funny how trevally used to be pretty much used for bait, and nowadays they might be one of the best sashimi fish we can catch, certainly around inshore waters year-round anyway.
We fished the whole turn of the tide, and then tried some spots off Plimmerton, where there’s been reports of good snapper catches recently, but came up empty handed on the reds.
Not everyone is struggling though, and good snapper catches around Kapiti are not uncommon as we get closer to the spawning season for these fish soon.
From shore, the drone fisho’s are getting into some good action around Te Horo, Raumati, and Kapiti Coast, and this form of fishing is really growing in popularity across the country.
The more purist surf casting has not been up to much lately up the coast due to weather conditions, and the cold makes night fishing even harder to motivate all but the mad-keen.
Surf casting in the harbour has been pretty good though, and snapper are about mixed in with the usual suspects of kahawai, red cod, and gurnard.  
Oriental Bay, Evan’s Bay and Flat Rock have turned up some really nice kingies on the slide baits.
Slide baiting is a really effective way of getting little jack macks way out past where you could ever cast and keeping them alive when they hit the water, essentially forced to swim in a one way direction to your waiting kingy or john dory.  Here’s how it’s done if you’ve never heard of the method or want some tips…

https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/slide-baiting
Some of our customers have been doing pretty well out at the Trench, catching some good bluenose, heaps of hoki, and of course the odd puka as well.
Saturday’s forecast is looking pretty good at this stage, and there’s another lull in the wind mid-week, so likely there will be a few boats out in the weekend.

Even the trusty dog struggled to round up a decent haul of whitebait this week! We got a few but wouldn’t be making more than a couple of fritters, although there are a few good catches starting to come up over Kapiti coast way and over at Lake Ferry. We expect the full moon and big tides to fire up a good run so could be worth dusting off the net.
Thankfully there are bigger fish in the sea, and there’s currently a very good run of decent sized gurnard about at the moment, in the harbour and around the surrounding coastlines.
From both the shore and by boat, big gurnard are always welcome for the pot.
Hitting the classic ledger rigs with around 3/0 hooks and fish bait like salted bonito etc generally being better than squid, gurnard like a bit of bling too.
Flasher rigs or baits with small lumo beads are often irresistible to grunters.
At the moment, with all the rain recently, there’s a lot of discoloration in the water, so these visual stimulants can help fish identify your bait.
There looks to be a bit of a settled period coming up, so expect a bit of traffic at the local ramps over the next while as we finally get to shoot out and give it a decent crack.
It’s definitely still winter conditions as far as water temps go, so often it requires a good effort with the bait and patience with building a good berley trail to get their noses up.
The real inshore run of snapper is not generally for a few months yet, but there’s always a chance of picking resident snapper and the odd schoolies out of the foul inshore, and off sandy areas close to reefs.
Out wider, the puka generally start to be easier to find and catch starting October as they ready for spawning.
It’s a good time for warehou at the moment.  These fireballs are a great sport fish commonly caught around 15 to 20 metres, and often mid-water, around reefs and foul, and they go really well!
Not only are they a good strong fighter, but they are much like a bluenose to eat.
Out at Hunters, Fisherman’s, Five Mile Reef etc, you’ll catch good three to six kilo fish, with the odd banger going up to ten.
They tend to be a winter fish, so we’re probably getting to the tail end of their peak season, but you never quite know how things will go from year to year.
It’s worth mentioning that the surf casting has been pretty good around Evan’s Bay lately, all the rocky points and even the wharves producing nice gurnard and the odd snapper along with the regular kahawai catches.

Given that the weather is not all that amazing, at least we’ve managed to get out a bit recently and made the most of the short windows. There’s another one coming up this weekend too, looking pretty good both Saturday and Sunday. The two-metre southerly swell will probably mean west coast and harbour are the places to fish for most comfortable conditions.
There’s plenty of snapper, gurnard, trevs to be found at the usual hunting grounds and this time of year fish are in their best condition for eating, so it’s nice to put a few in the bin.
The fine spells are allowing a few good puka to be caught, which you would expect this part of the season.
Another fine day at sea in Wellington ;-) on board the 40 foot 'Destiny'
If your rig is equipped to get over to D’Urville the puka and kingy fishing there is peaking and there are some real donkeys of both species being landed.
For whatever reason we seem to be getting summer fishing right through winter now, with steady snapper action, but far be it from a complaint.  
It’s great to see more people out there doing it, and discovering there’s plenty of action if you actually get a line in the water.
Snapper fishing from boat and shore has been as good as you could ever expect at times.  
There’s been plenty of big reds caught off the beaches up towards Kapiti, and Palliser bay is still providing some exciting fishing for land based anglers also.
With the southerly swell it might be a bit marginal for a bit now, but once it clears up expect the good fishing to continue.
Puka are a core target species mid-winter, and that’s probably what I’ll be having a crack at this weekend.
Depending how we go on the puka, the deeper reef systems are holding nice big terakihi, big mackerel, snaps and trevs etc, so it’s a good plan while you’re all the way out there to limit the catch of hapuka (which the slack tide window kind of forces you to anyway) and try for some other species out wider offshore.
When the southerly allows access to the Trench it’s been going pretty good for puka, bass and big bluenose.  
A real go-to spot for turn of the tide is the ‘bass patch’ around 260 to 280 metres on the far side of the Trench.  
The fish move about a bit so spend some time prospecting with the sounder and try to get down on top of them when you pick up sign.  
There’s some really big fish about out there which is good to see.
Inshore the winter months often require a good bit of berley and patience to get the bite going, so come and pick up your supplies at our Rongotai shop and have a bit more of a chat about the fishing while you’re here.

True winter fishing conditions at the moment, which sees us slow right down in the bait shop, but on the flip side, does allow us to get out on the good days and get some fishing in. When you can actually peg the window, the fishing can be really awesome, and we’ve enjoyed that on a few occasions in the last couple of weeks.
Some nice fat puka out there at the moment in prime winter nick
The fish are in incredible condition, whether snaps, or puka, the fat content is high and the fish are in their best shape for eating.
Snapper fishing in particular is good when you get it right, with plenty of big fish around, and in good numbers, from the shore and the boat too.
We fished the spit off Ocean beach and were inundated by kahawai, which is only good if that’s what you’re after.
Where I should have been was over at Whangamoana (east of Lake Ferry towards Palliser Bay) where they were catching decent snapper from late afternoon into the evening, including some really nice fish up to nearly six kilos.
We had a couple of good charters last week, and enjoyed some great snapper fishing off Plimmerton straight off the bat, out in about 40 metres off the sand, and we had reports of good snapper fishing off Vern’s as well.
The surfcasting is still good once the water is right, with good moki and plenty of snapper being landed from all the popular haunts.
Pretty much any reef structure around the coast is capable of producing big winter snapper at the moment right in to five metres, and you’ll also get them out in the deep, and off the sand if you work hard enough to find them.
It’s the getting out there that’s the hard part, and that makes it great fun for those that have the luxury of being able to get away when the windows open mid-week.

There’s some great looking weather windows and nice small tides coming up, so a good time to get out there and into it. Evans bay has been producing some good snapper this week. Kapiti coast and Palliser Bay have been quiet but don’t write them off. There’s still a good chance of finding fish in numbers and the odd big snapper at this time of year.
Makara and Otaki beach are both worth a crack for a kingi as well.  
We got some really nice puka up to 20 kilos off the Makara coast in about 190 metres of water so it’s great to see these fish in good numbers and size again.
The snapper and trevally action off the south end of Mana has also been good in around 35 metres.
More Rays Bream action has been fun, with these great little scrappers also equally good in the pan.  We’ve been having great catches of these silver bullets off Vern’s recently.
Rays bream are prolific out west (midwater) on the 70-200mtr reef areas up and down the coast and they are prolific in most other areas out west, holding mid water on the 70-200 metre reef areas up and down the coast.
In fact, pretty much everywhere is firing for good fish at the moment out on the boat, so it’s just a matter of choosing your favourite target species and going to work on them.
A friend got a really nice 20lb snapper off the beach at Paraparaumu last week which he released, the ultimate reward for a land based fisho, and not bad even off a boat.
There are some big kingis being caught at Hunters, Kapiti and off Boom Rock, and the south coast is also turning up decent kings out deeper around 100 metres.
Snapper fishing has been good at depths of 15mtrs down to 50 metres up and down the west coast and in the harbour from 6-25 metres.
South coast hapuku fishing has been a bit hit and miss but well worth a crack as they are starting to fatten up prior to the winter spawning run.
It’s been a real mixed bag lately of trevs, blue mack, gurnard, snaps, JD and the odd kingi inshore fishing around Wellington, so enjoy the autumn weather when it offers up a good day and best of luck out there.

The surfcasting has just come back on big time in the last couple of days. It’s been great after a quiet patch through the full moon phase and southerlies, to see the fish come back on nice and strong. It seems to be a bit better from Paraparaumu north up to TeHoro, rather than south where it was previously firing. One of our staff limited out up there last night after dark, but there is still plenty of good fishing before dark, and you can still get them if the tides and other factors play ball.
Wellington Angler Jay Goldsack with a 13kg Trumpeter
‍
You don’t have to cast too far to get them as well, if you are careful to target the trenches and guts that hold fish chasing food in close.
There’s also big action around the Otaki River mouth with good kingy fishing available using the plentiful supply of live baits that seem to be congregating there.
Slide baiting etc doing the damage, and there’s been really good kingfish activity as a regular occurrence with fish up to twenty kilos being landed.
This gathering of kingies is in contrast to most of the other popular places recently, where the kings have been a bit thin on the ground for surf casters.
Out on the boat, it’s been a bit tough getting charters out there with the Covid effect, but plenty of our customers are out there doing well.
Snapper are in good supply in close around the mana Bridge area, and just south of the Bridge down towards Makara in around 35 metres provided us with an excellent mixed bag of snapper, trevs, blue macks, gurnard etc.
We had all sorts of fish coming on board as the tide turned, but when the tide started running out a bit more rapidly the snapper really became dominant which commonly happens in a lot of areas.
Just have to watch the spinies, as they can ruin the party and its best to move if you land anywhere near ten or so.
The harbour is absolutely alive with kahawai at the moment, and this is providing some fun action from the shore on spinners.
Not so much kingfish action to go with them, but there will be the odd big moocher around making a live kahawai under a balloon a solid option still.
Good snapper numbers in the harbour mean that it’s well worth a shot, and there’s plenty of by-catch in the way of gurnard, trevs and some really big blue mackerel.
Straight out of the unusual box… Inshore fishermen around Kapiti are picking up Rays Bream, normally a more deep water commercial species.
These piranha-like blue-silver bullets are a pretty out there fish to catch on lighter gear and in shallower water.  Really aggressive they will smash most baits, lures, and even sinkers.  They go pretty good too, strong like a big trev and give a good scrap all the way to the boat.
They’re great eating too, a fairly white flesh and lovely cooked using just about any method.
Normally a blue-water fish, these have even been washing up on some of the west coast local beaches.
There’s still albacore tuna off Kapiti,  and the run of little bluefin tuna that we were enjoying seems to have passed through, although now is the time that the bigger bluefin models around 30 – 40 kilos start turning up off Cape Palliser and Tora.
Normally there would be more caught, there’s just not the angler traffic out there to generate bigger catch numbers and intel, but if you want to target these fish, now is the time to start trying, launching from Ngawi or Tora.
Another feature last week, some big trumpeter being landed, typical of this time of year.
One of our regulars scored a really nice specimen around 13 kilos on a jig in around 100 metres off the south coast!
Swells and weather always limit the time you can spend out there, but trumpeter can be a surprise when you are targeting kingies and puka.
Palliser Bay and Ocean beach is also doing well for shore-based anglers, with good gurnard and decent snaps.  It’s typically a good time of year out there now, and went right through April last year.
Fisherman’s and Hunter’s have been fishing pretty well for tarakihi, snaps, blue cod etc, but don’t seem to be providing amazing puka fishing of late, but if you can get out the other side off the Brothers, and all the way into Stevens and D’Urville, it’s mecca there about now for big kings and snapper.

Well given the last few weeks has been pretty punishing with the southerlies taking their toll on fishing conditions, and definitely dropping the temp, there’s not as much to report as I would like 😊 From the shore, up further north has been fishing really well for spells, then turning off to dead for a while. Pretty hard to pick why, although the full moon in the last few days is certainly a likely factor.
Doing it after dark. The best beach fishing from shore lately, up north, is when the sun has said see ya tomorrow!
‍
Primarily the best fishing is after dark up Otaki and north, so the moon has a big part to play.
I expect there’s a bit of good fishing to be had in the nxt few days as the weather is set to finally give us a decent crack at it.
It’s often quite exciting after the fishing has been forced to take a break as you never quite know how it’s going to fire up out there.
There’s still a few good snapper around, although it seems to have tailed off from peak summer fishing.
Our more recent trips out, sheltering up around Mana, were pretty devoid of snapper, although plenty of teri’s, trevs and kahawai happily made up the pot.
There are still sporadic catches of the little bluefin off areas up around Foxton, and a few albies north of Kapiti, but nothing to really write home about.
The southerly swell may have also been the culprit in turning the water a bit greener recently, when previously it had been nice and blue.
In the harbour, snapper are still biting, and there’s still some good kingfish action to be had for those making the most of our weather windows.
And speaking of windows, the next four days are showing 10 knot variables so the boat ramps might get a bit of a hiding.  Could pay to get there early and hit your favourite spot with good mid-morning high tides on Saturday.
After a bit of a break, all the good places like Hunter’s, Fisherman’s, and the back of Mana should offer up some nice action.
With the water temps a bit colder I would be trying a bit deeper like 40 – 60 metres, but will know after a couple of trips where it’s trending.

With the weather offering us a few good days and more than a few bad ones, we might wish for January back at the moment, but coming into autumn there are often good settled spells, so fingers crossed. Last week was pretty good fishing, and we are on a bit of a roll south end of Mana at the moment. No matter what the tide was doing, fishing was pretty solid, and targeting in a bit shallower and fishing some back eddies we were able to pick up some really nice snapper. Around the area there’s also some very good tarakihi, trevs, blue mackerel, kahawai and of course the odd good kingy. Turn of the tide there gives us the opportunity to shoot out deeper and target the puka, which has been reasonably successful with consistent results not always in the same spots as the fish move around.
There’s probably less fish around than I have seen in the last couple of years, but sometimes the patterns go that way a bit, and they can pick up during the changing seasons.
We are fishing the 150 metre drop off all the way along from Mana down to Makara in the 150 to 170 metre depth range, and searching for sign along the bank will generally reward the patient sounder watcher.
You can also head out further to the 200 plus drop off but we have had not much need to head out there as we do ok without the extra travel.
Even sheltered up inside Mana has been producing some good sized snapper, a fish species that appears to be even more widespread now, and always a welcome addition to the day’s catch.
You can get onto snapper easily in most places that have a bit of foul or shelter, and that means anything from as shallow as 5 to 10 metres, right out into the deep.
Surfcasters are doing well on snapper too, mostly from Paikok up to Te Horo.
It’s not always easy work getting good results off sandy beach, but good efforts will generally be rewarded with persistence.
The keen fisho’s and local club members have been doing really well up there, but the catch is, they seem to come on about an hour after dark.
This being the case it pays to get set up and established, then you’re familiar with things around you and how comfortable you are to wade out after losing the light.
Waders or a surf wetsuit-type-thing are a big advantage as often a bit of distance is required to get out to the second channel, whereas at high tide fishing the first channel is often enough.
 
Another great catch off the Otaki beach I came across...


Tīwhane Pota, with help from daughter Rangituia caught a massive kingy.
Using a live bait kahawai under small balloon, 11/0 live bait hook, 200lb mono trace, 50lb ball bearing swivel on 24kg main using rollered game rod!  Not your typical beach rig.
His words:
“Got the idea to use the game rod after seeing birds working out from the surf club, huge tail splashes amongst kahawai.
Thought it was kingfish, first day no luck. Next day was within 30 seconds of letting the kahawai get out with the balloon.
Once hooked let a young fella reel it in. Had to assist the poor wee blighter as killed his arms.
Easy as walking up the beach and getting the line back on the walk back to the water.
Folks at the river mouth thought I was nuts. 'How ya gonna cast that out?' they asked with a laugh.”
Length - 134cm from head to V of tail
On the bathroom scales it went 32.7kg
There’s also been some boomer kingies caught land based closer to the city, off Sunshine Bay and in town around Oriental, Flat Rock, and Evan’s Bay.
Kapiti is fishing really well when you can get out there, with good albacore catches out the back of the island and northwards, and not so many bluefin of late.
Tons of good snapper and kingy fishing out there, all systems are go on that front, around the popular reef systems all round the island, so depending on what way the wind is blowing, there’s always a fishable spot at the moment.
Closer in, the harbour is fishing nicely, especially for snapper, where Point Gordon has been pretty much the story, although Ward Island is proving good for snapper too.
If you want to fish the wreck (look for it off Point Halswell toward Somes) it’s good for kingies, tarakihi, snapper and heaps of other species.  The trick is staying a bit wide of it to avoid losing your anchor on it, and drifting is not so great as you then lose your gear fairly easily.
Setting up a berley trail drifting into the wreck as you sit off the edge of it is generally a good way to go with dropper rigs and straylines doing the business.
Get set for a good weekend coming up.
Good luck and tight lines.

Over the last few weeks, we’ve been blessed with some of the best fishing weather you could hope to get, and long may it continue hopefully. The buzz in Wellington has been around the schools of bluefin that have been around and possibly have now started to tail off having passed through on their way up north. They are still around, but a little harder to get onto now.
Being smaller fish around 15 – 20 kilos, there have also been some fishermen having better results casting smaller lures such as microjigs into them, rather than trolling the skippy or small tuna plastics as you would usually do.
A good by-product of targeting bluefin have been albacore, which are also a good fish to target with jigs if you get into a situation where they are around the boat.
There’s also been some good albies caught off the back of Kapiti too.  We’ve not seen many out back of Mana despite some good blue water, all the action appears to be Kapiti north.
Bluefin – wise mostly the fish have been in 30 – 50 metres off Otaki and northwards.
Who knows, with the water as warm as it is, and the prevalence of tuna, there could be the odd sneaky marlin in there for those prepared to burn the time and target them.
Some nice Wellington snaps for the charters
‍
On the normal fishing front, it’s been pretty full on, with great fishing for snapper, tarakihi, cod, kingies and all the other usual suspects.
Our charter has been burning the fuel almost every day steaming out with plenty of folks keen for a fish.
West coast is the one, from Kapiti down to Ohau we’ve had awesome snapper fishing and got some good puka too.
Targeting the deep we’ve even pulled up a 15 pound snapper and a 30 pound kingy out of 170 metres!
The puka are certainly there, and some days we’ve really fired off whilst others have been harder, so you have to put in the time carefully navigating the bottom with your sounder to find where the fish might be holding.  
Tracking banks and shelves and even trolling wee tuna lures around at 6 knots while you watch the sounder is a good way to find your next favourite puka spot.
It’s not always easy, as fishing goes, so spots that fire one day are often empty the next, and other times it’s just about being patient and waiting for the bite.
There’s been several reports of twenty pound snapper and one over 30!
The south has not been as fishable as out west, but the surfcasters have been rewarded with plenty of snapper off Ocean Beach when it’s fishable, with some really good sized snaps.
The land based guys up towards Kapiti coast have been doing well at night, with plenty of good rewards for the effort put in through the dark.  The water condition is great, nice and clean, nice and blue, nice and warm, and that usually makes for some great fishing.
Snapper fishing on the whole seems to have improved off the south coast, and really targeting snaps either with berley, stray lines etc, or drifting with softbaits and jigs has pain off for a lot of anglers putting in the hard yards.
The Trench has fished pretty well for puka and bluenose if you can get out there.
Kingies are around in good numbers, with plenty being caught off Boom, quite a few out of the harbour, Flat Rock and around Eastbourne all being good producers.
Live baits (slide baiting or under a float) are the go, but there’s still been good results with whole baits and even stick baits.
The moki run off Palliser Bay continues to produce good fish up to ten pound, so all round, it’s a pretty good season so far down here.

Happy new year all, and welcome to another summer in the calm fishing paradise of the Wellington region. Just a quick update before we get a good period of settled weather top try and get a better handle on how our summer action is going to shape up. To be fair, considering the rest of the country is seeing some wind thanks to our January cyclone, Wellington is not alone with limited fishable windows, and with some interesting turn ups for the book when you do manage to get out.
Bluefin tuna have been turning up, perhaps due to the unusual warm water temps, up and down the country, with smaller 15 to 20 kg fish being landed off the west coast of Raglan in just 40 metres of water, and also wider out off the north Island east coast.
Perhaps it’s not so unusual then that there’s been a run of these fish turning up in only 20 to 30 metres from Otaki to Waitarere!
That’s not the only tuna action we’ve seen.  Out wide off mana and Kapiti the albacore have moved in, so if you are keen on getting into these tasty guys here’s a bit more about how to target them.
The puka bite is pretty good at the moment, and we’ve had some good results fishing off Makara for them, and if you are able to get out to Nicholson’s Trench it can be very rewarding.
Not only puka out there, but good bluenose, gemmys and bass.
On the west coast, it has not always been easy to find the snapper, but there’s some good fishing when you do.
Pretty much most of the west coast is also fishing ok for cod, and tarakihi currently too.
For snaps, fishing in close around where the foul and weeds meet the sand, and also out a bit deeper has seen some good fish coming on board.
For the land-based anglers, Oriental, and Evan’s Bay has produced some really great snapper fishing and the slide baiters are picking up some good kingfish, including specimens up to 40 lb.
Palliser Bay continues to perform well for surf casters, with moki still around in decent form, and a few good snaps and the usual kahawai.
Tight lines and stay tuned, we will have some more info coming in soon.

My daughter, Jade, with a nice moki, and a good haul of snapper yesterday from Pukerua Bay. Thankfully, things picking up as a couple of weeks back, the fishing was decidedly average.
We were really enjoying a bumper moki run, and then it all seemed to just quiet off.  Even running crayfish baits out under a drone was not getting results where we would normally expect to be smashing it.
I put it down to dirty water conditions.  Moki like it clear, and this can make a massive difference to the catch.
After a couple of trips this week, thankfully, the fishing seems to be back on, and we now see moki running all along the south coast, including Sinclair Head this week.
 
Kapiti has been fishing reasonably, but we had a really tough patch around Pukerua Bay, Mana, Boom, and most of our favourite haunts.
Snapper in particular, have just not been around in the numbers we’ve seen over the last couple of years.  Having said that, there are always good fishout there, it’s just the pattern we are noticing of harder fishing.
 
Spring is typically challenging to fish as far as wind conditions go, and perhaps this is just a temporary glitch on the season for us.  This is not just us doing it tough, but other charter guys we talk to and plenty of customer feedback from in the shop.
It’s not all doom and gloom, with the Trench providing a few good puka and bluenose for those that have been able to fish 35 odd kms out from there.
Good sized fish, but not a lot of opportunities to get to them.
 
However, having managed to get out a bit more this week, weare seeing things pick up a bit, and got a couple of nice snapper off PukeruaBay yesterday, so hopefully a good sign of things getting up to speed.
Snapper are also coming back on it appears, further up and down the west coast, and with temps around 18 degrees we would expect to see some good results becoming more consistent.
The harbour is fishing pretty well with some nice snapper and kingfish caught both from shore and boat from Evans Bay, and Point Gordon.
Tarakihi fishing is going well off Vern’s in around 70metres, so other areas in the zone may also provide some good fishing once the weather gives us a few settled days.
That does not look like it’s due to happen this week, so I guess we sit tight for a bit longer and take our chances when they present.

Spring fishing starting to fire up nicely now, with a bit of settled weather helping Wellington anglers nicely. We’ve been out quite a bit since before Labour Weekend making the most of it, along with every other boatie in the area 😊 The weather pattern change has just levelled off the south coast pretty much for the last four or five days, which has also helped clear the water right up, awesome for both fishing and diving. Last Saturday saw hundreds of boats out, the busiest we’ve seen out there for a long time, and by all accounts, some good fishing to boot.

‍
The thing that excites me the most at the moment is the beginning of the moki season.  These awesome fish are so good fun to catch, and of course, make pretty good eating too.
They are a real land-based fishing prize, and it’s usually the surf casters that are picking these fish up off the beaches and weed lines from shore.
It’s a seasonal run when the fishing really peaks for moki, and right now they have started to appear.
The best place in my book, for targeting them is Palliser Bay.  The really keen anglers will head all the way to White Rock, but there are heaps of other good places you can go to catch them.
Other great spots like Ocean Beach, and Whangaimoana, are much easier to fish and there’s good moki getting caught there right now.
Fishing for this particular species requires a bit of perseverance and dedication, but the patience is worth it in the end.
The type of terrain favoured by moki is also habitat to a lot of reddies, kelpies and other ‘junk’ fish that will pick away at the baits and sometimes create a bit of a nuisance of themselves.
You’ll want to be fishing right up against the reefs on a lot of occasions, where the fish shelter and feed, which means putting up with the bycatch as par for the course.
Also, if you’re serious about catching moki you really need to use shellfish or crab for bait, or even cray tail, which takes extra effort to bind to the hooks, but makes all the difference.
Keep persevering and you will end up with the win eventually, which is really rewarding and makes a nice change from picking up the normal species.  You’ll also have a great chance of catching snapper using the shellfish baits too.
The water has really cleaned up which is when the south coast and Palliser fish the best.  After the moki have started to turn up, perhaps triggered by an increase in the water temp, other species also tend to come on.
There has been some massive gurnard taken recently, and nice snapper out there too.
Palliser Bay is easy to get to by boat from the harbour on a decent day.  As soon as you get to Turakirae Head, you’re at some of the best fishing the south coast has to offer, and past there a bit further towards Ngawi is a big drop off you can fish starting at 50 metres and down to 300 metres.
Here you can catch anything from big snapper, cod, teri’s and kingfish, and even decent hapuka down to 100 metres, and out deeper puka, bass and bluenose.
The Trench is fishing really well for bluenose at the moment, with plenty of big ones around.
Also, nice puka and bass fishing in the present conditions out there.
As we expect after a lot of time off the water, the west coast is also fishing pretty solid.  The usual haunts, Fisherman’s, Hunter’s etc, all fish pretty well in the right moon and tide conditions and big kahawai workups out at Hunter’s is always a healthy sign.
There has been some excellent snapper fishing of late, and this time of year the big ones start moving in quite close. Surfcasters are picking up snapper in good double figures, with the odd 20 pounder north of Peka Peka.
Our part time deckie, Anton, managed a lovely fish around the magic 20-pound mark last week (see photo above) , and other reports of similar fish are coming into the shop from time to time now.
Once you’ve fished the deeper ground around the turn of the tides, it can be really productive patrolling the 70 metre mark anywhere from Ohau to Kapiti up the coast, where there are anything from teri’s, snapper, kingfish and even the odd puka straying in.
It’s a good time to be out there, so get into it.

Just a quick update to last week's report. Wind is still playing a factor in preventing consistent time on the water, and we have only been out once or twice since the last report, and fishing has continued to be pretty successful, with tarakihi, puka and kingies out at the Hunter Bank.
A lovely john dory, always a bonus for the pot
‍
West of Hunter Bank, as reported last week, there have been some really good snapper and kingis’ caught on slow jigs as deep as 120 metres, and there’s always the chance of puka or big teris’ here as well.
This seems to be a bit of a thing as Palliser Bay has been turning up good snapper out as deep as 100 metres also.
Snapper seem to be pretty abundant off Makara one day and gone the next - in a more traditional 60 – 80 metres.
Boom rock produced a nice kingi and snapper for us the other day but the couta were in plague proportions and spooked tarakihi.
Verns has been good for teris (70-80mtrs) on the turn of tide.
On the last trip we caught 6 snapper just south of the mana bridge as well as a heap of kahawai
The harbour has been a bit quieter and a few too many spiney dogs are around, but this may fire up a bit as we get warmer, and the water clears up a bit. Still some good catches of gurnard to be had though.
Shore fishers have been enjoying excellent gurnard fishing inside Lambton Harbour.
Evan’s Bay has had a few snapper coming in at places like flat rock and Balena bay.
Kapiti is fishing pretty well for snapper at the north end, but we have reports it’s been not as good off the southern end. Spineys have been a problem closer to shore but when the water cleans up this should change.
Nicholson’s trench fired up plenty of big bluenose on the last fishable day and consistent tarakihi and blue cod have been taken further inshore along with the odd snapper and kingfish.
Some good catches of whitebait have been taken at Waikanae, Otaki, lake ferry and a few lesser-known spots.
It’s perfect time for surfcasters in Palliser Bay for the run of blue moki, gurnard and potentially snapper.
Best fishing is when the water is clean (less than a mtr southerly swell)
Places like long beach, karori stream beach, Fitzroy Bay and Wainui are good (closer to wgtn) shore fishing spots at this time of the year as well - bluecod, moki, gurnard and tarakihi.

Getting a break from the wind. Not so easy at this time of year, and true to form some decent time on the water has been pretty hard to come by of late. On the brief occasions we’ve managed to get out, fishing has been pleasantly successful, with terakihi, puka and kingies all playing ball out at the Hunter Bank.
We lost a couple of really good fish, but still managed to land a couple.
Out west of Hunter Bank there have been some really good snapper caught on slow jigs as deep as 120 metres, and there’s always the chance of puka here as well.
This seems to be a bit of a thing as Palliser Bay has been turning up good snapper out as deep as 100 metres also.
Snapper seem to be pretty abundant off Makara in a more traditional 60 – 80 metres.
The harbour has been a bit quieter and a few too many spiney dogs are around, but this may fire up a bit as we get warmer, and the water clears up a bit.  Still some good catches of gurnard to be had though.
Kapiti is fishing pretty well for snapper at the north end, but we have reports it’s been not as good off the southern end.
The weather is looking pretty good from this Friday through to mid next week, so we will try and get out there hopefully for a few days and get a better picture of what’s going on.

Fishing is great at the moment. Particularly for snapper, that is pretty weird as we normally expect them to just be gone at this time of the year. Not so at the moment, there are snapper being caught just about anywhere around Wellington, and in the harbour there’s a huge proliferation of juvenile fish. Give these guys a couple of years and if all goes well there should be some awesome fishing in the harbour. Point Gordon is the place to be currently, the deeper hole off there that drops off around 25 metres seems to congregate them, along with a few decent sized blue cod.
There’s also still plenty of kingfish around, and a good customer of ours managed a nice 30 pounder off the shore on a stick bait recently.  Can’t say where as he swore me to secrecy but rocky outcrops are where kingies cruise the weed lines so perhaps persevering with stick baits is worth your while.  Big fish off the rocks are always more fun than from a boat and a good kingy on a stick bait is epic action.
Out west, Hunters is still fishing well for trevs, snapper, kingies and terakihi.  There are also good warehau out there, but Fisherman's is the best place for targeting these fish if that’s what you are specifically after.  
The challenge with fishing here is the tide, as you want a bit moving but not roaring through, so catching it either side of a smaller tide is the best bet.
Verns reef (just north of Boom on the 70 metre mark) is producing some good sized tarakihi if that’s your target fish.
There’s a fair few big blue mackerel around that make awesome live kingfish baits or are great smoked or eaten as sashimi.
The puka are still running strong and we were out off Boom Rock fishing the mud in around 250 to 300 metres, where we got nothing initially, then our mate got six after we left, so they are out there.
South coast is good too.  The Trench is fishing well for puka, bass and bluenose.  Off Karori it’s been good with a few trumpeter turning up which is not that common.  You’ll pick these up as bycatch sometimes if you are targeting puka in the shallower 100 metre spots.  The rougher ground the better, which is why the Karori light area is pretty good.
There’s some excellent cod and terakihi fishing off the south coast now that it has cleaned up and the water is nice and clear.

It’s fair to say the weather has been pretty nasty to us over the last few weeks and getting out fishing has been out of the question. However, when we do get these big snaps come through you can always count on some good fishing out the other side. Before the big fronts, the fishing was pretty good, full on all over the place.
One of my mates that runs a charter was catching some really big kingies up to the magic thirty kilo mark out at the Trench while chasing bluenose and puka.
Those are big fish to be hauling up from the deep, and it’s not uncommon to get them out there around June and July on the ‘shallower’ banks around 120 to 160 metres.
Out at Hunters was also going really well with kingies just nailing jigs like no tomorrow, same at Kapiti.
There’s also been good numbers of warehou turning up at Hunters which is good to see.
One of the best eating fish out there, john dory, seem to be around at the moment, and these fish although not that super common around Wellington, are always welcome additions to the pot.
You’ll target jds in the shallower reefy areas and usually catch them on live baits or big slow moving soft baits around the weed beds and other structure, as well as a few that hang around wharf pylons.
In winter, it seems to be more productive to fish a bit deeper, around fifty to sixty metres.  Out in this zone there are big teri’s, cod, snapper and just about all the other species at any given time.
We fished north end of Hunters yesterday and anchored up in around seventy metres for some awesome terakihi fishing, with good specimens around two kilos, and a couple of nice snapper on the turn of the tide, so it will be worth getting out there again with some decent weather coming up.
Its always good this time of year down towards Ohau in fifty to seventy metres and I expect the fishing should be dynamite there once things calm down nicely.
There will be heaps of good fishing action coming up, with some settled spells, and good moon and smaller tide phases.
Kapiti has been producing plenty of good snapper and kingies, and my deckie has been firing out to the hundred metre mark north of Kapiti in search of puka, and managed to get onto some really big terakihi.  This is a good area to target this time of year with plenty of bottom structure to prospect and always the chance of picking up hapuka and decent terakihi.
Kapiti is a good area to fish slow jigs, kabura and inchiku style jigs for snapper and kings, but sometimes bait is a better nose turner in winter, so it can pay to have both on board.
Make the most of the clear weather windows, and stay safe.

Well, we’re into June, and it’s officially feeling like winter in Wellington a lot of the time at the moment. One thing is still hot though, and that’s the snapper fishing. The boaties have been having a better time of it as they can get out a bit deeper to clearer water, but there’s still good fish coming in from the surf casters. You still have to put the time in but there are some really good fish around on all coasts and in Wellington harbour. Top spot has been fishing the Bridge at Mana, with four really great trips in a row out there, catching decent snapper as well as trevs, kingies and gurnard.
Fish the area in about twenty metres just before it starts coming up to about six metres all along the Bridge, pretty much both sides.
Just anchor up and start berleying in twenty and the drift should take care of the rest.
‍
Top Spots
‍
Pukerua Bay and Boom have also been firing, and my mates managed a limit in just an hour and a half last week fishing forty to fifty metres or so.  
There’s still plenty of snapper around in closer too, around five to ten metres out of the structure and shelter.
We’re all about the bait, but soft baiting recently with the new Daiwa Bait Junkie soft baits has proven really effective.  
We’ve been doing well with the five-inch versions, but look forward to getting out there with the seven inch models soon to target some of the bigger snaps and kingies.
Puka fishing is about to enter it’s peak, with the fish big and fat, and in great condition feeding up ready to spawn.  
That’s a good reason to also be very careful to limit your catch and preserve the fishery for the future.  
Puka are big fish and you get a lot of meat off just one or two fish, so we always like to stop and move on to other species once you have a puka or two on board.
Even so, we have not heard a lot of accounts of good catches yet, but the time will come shortly no doubt.
Surfcasting
Surfcasting is at its best when the water is clean and not too much swell.
Spots like White rock, Whangamoana and Ocean Beach have all produced good moki, snapper, gurnard and spotty sharks, with reports of a lot of  fish over five kgs being caught.
Evans Bay continues to produce snapper, as well as the Paikakariki to Raumati stretch.
Some good spotty sharks and gurnard have also been caught at Breaker Bay and Seatoun.
It appears the tarakihi have come back on the bite lately, particularly off the south coast where they have not been hit quite so hard because of the weather conditions.  
There’s good terakihi fishing in close, like off west ledge just outside the harbour entrance in 25 metres, that’s a classic spot and there always seem to be fish there.  
But when you go off Baring Head, Turakerai Head, and off Sinclair fishing in 35 to 55 metres is the go.
It seems deep, but targeting as deep as 100 metres for terakihi will often get you the big ones.  
Obviously, there’s limited time you can get out there, but you might also pick up some good by – catch as last winter we were getting snapper and kingies at that depth, and you might even pull a few school puka and warehau, and some big blue cod out depending on your luck on the day.
Harbour boat
The snapper fishing success is still happening off Point Gordon, Falcon Shoal and around Ward Island.
A few trevs, gurnard, blue Mack’s and plenty of big kahawai are also getting caught regularly too, so make the most of your opportunities and we will see you out there.

Plenty of snapper and kingis still about in Wellington for boaties and shore fishos alike, and its showing no signs of slowing down, although kingis can be a bit harder to catch off the shore now. West coast – Pukerua bay and Kapiti have been the hotspots for snapper lately with fish up to 18lb taken recently. Hunter’s was going off for kingis the other day, but other usually good places like Boom, the north end of Kapiti and south end of Mana are still producing a few as well.
Andrew Frazer with a nice snapper caught on a bait junkie bruised banana at Pukerua Bay on one of our recent charters. Note the bite mark!
‍
Good tarakihi fishing recently at Verns, Hunters and south end of Kapiti.
Out wide has been a little bit quiet on puka but that should change going into prime time for biggies which is coming up from June through to end of July.
South coast
When fishable,  it’s been great for tarakihi and cod action, with a few gurnard and trevs about as well for good measure.
If you are heading out over the next week or so, some good spots worth trying would be Five Mile Reef, Airport Reef, Turakerei, Homes, and Fitzroy Bay.
Palliser bay (surfcasting) has produced some excellent snapper fishing, and there have also been good catches of gurnard, moki and spotty sharks, paricularly when the water is clean.
Snapper up to the magic twenty pound mark have been caught off the shore over the last couple of weeks at Ocean Beach.
In the harbour.  
Nice snapper fishing is still readily available both from shore, and the boaties are getting them too.
Gurnard have been a little bit more sparse than previous seasons, but some big kahawai have been around, and in better numbers recently.
Good shore -based spots to try include Flat Rock, Point Jerningham, and behind Fryburg Pool.
If you’re out in the boat, try The Wreck, Point Gordon, south end of Somes Island, and Falcon Shoal.

I’m pleased to report the last couple of weeks have been pretty bloody good actually, we had a bad spell for a few weeks there, but a break in the weather has seen some good fishing, especially off the west coast. It can still be a bit gnarly out wide, and I don’t have much to report from out at the Trench, but there has been tons of good fishing from mana down to Ohau.
Snapper have been close in with the water still 17 degrees, and plenty of kingies around too.
There’s been plenty of good kingfish action off Boom on jigs, and no doubt livies would be a good proposition as well.
The puka action has been steady if not amazing, and we are getting a few, and hearing back from customers that they are coming on board out past Mana.
All in all pretty good fishing for those that have been able to escape mid-week.
We’ve had four back-to-back charters and have had solid results on all of them.  
The fishing around Pukerua Bay and Makara has been outstanding, mostly for snapper, kings, gurnard, john dory and trevs.
It’s been all systems go for the boaties, not as great for the land-based guys although there was a recent run of really good snapper and moki caught out at the Spit over in Palliser bay in the clear water conditions.  Some fish going up to 9 kilos.
Unfortunately, the weather is really looking to pack in a bit now for a few days, right in time for the weekend 😊 But there might be a shot Saturday with northerlies around 15 knots before it really kicks in.
The harbour is fishing well, with plenty of snapper about, from shore and land.  Boaties fishing around Somes, Ward and Eastbourne, and Evan’s Bay is the place for the surf casters.

We are still in full-on snapper mode, and when it’s fishable, there are tons of good fish and they appear to be all in close, with surf casters and boaties all withing reach of picking up a good feed. It’s not every trip that comes up trumps, but when the conditions calm down and the bite times are on, there are a lot of good fish being landed.
The last couple of weeks have been pretty rubbish on the weekends for fishing, and we always see that in the traffic and general quietness through the shop.
It’s pretty standard for this time of year and certainly for Wellington, but the good news is really that there is plenty of great fishing once you can actually get out there.
Lovely snapper south end of Mana
‍
Surf casters are scoring pretty well around Paekakariki and Roumati still, and everywhere from in the harbour, to right up both coasts seem to be providing good catches of our perhaps most favourite fish, and it’s not limited to snapper by any means.
Kingies are still very much on the programme, and we’ve had some really excellent kingfish action right in close off the south end of Mana recently.
They are hanging around in water as shallow as fifteen metres, and we have been scoring nice fish on livies and whole baits.  It’s a bit shallow to jig but you might want to have a go at stick baiting if they are around in numbers.
Big smiles for a big kingy at Mana
‍
In that depth, a livie out under a float on a nice two metre trace should be hard to beat though.
South end of Mana often gets overlooked, but it holds good fish and sometimes it’s one of your only options when the weather conditions are being unkind.
There are still some good puka around out deep, and in the last few days a couple of mates scored some nice sized fish out around Fisherman’s.
Tuna have been a bit quiet, but are still definitely there.  The recent tuna tournament out at Kapiti had one good day, and one not so good, but saw plenty of fish caught, and some of which weighed in.  Heaviest fish of the day was actually a slender tuna just over 10 kilos.
There’s been some good moki fishing hanging in there after a bumper run earlier in the year, with a 6 kg specimen from the harbour a few days ago.
It’s basically all systems go whenever the conditions allow.
Although snapper and kingies are going pretty well, this year we have really noticed that the consistency of a few other staple species has not really been there.
Tarakihi, widely publicised to be in a bit of a decline, have definitely been harder to find on a regular basis, and even the old cod fishing has not been as reliable as in past years.
It’s a shame as we really do depend on these fish for the table and with luck, they will come back on as they sometimes do.  They have been there some days, and just seem to be gone the next.
The south coast seems to still be fine, but it is often harder to get out there and fish, which could account for the numbers still being robust.  It’s always been a bit like that though, so hopefully things could pick up with time.
The other fish we have really found to be conspicuous in their absence, is the humble kahawai.
They have been in really short supply this season, which is not such a problem to boaties, but land based fisho’s often rely on a kahawai or two to make their trip worthwhile.  
I’m not sure if these fish are valued highly by everyone, but we certainly want to see them in the ecosystem around here.

Kapiti has been fishing pretty well lately. I wouldn’t go so far as to say red hot, but good snapper fishing, some nice kingies, and albacore out wide are all on the cards at the moment. There are even a few skippies around at the moment, we’ve seen them jumping out around the 200 metre mark when we were out the back of Mana looking for hapuka, so you might pick up the odd one if you’re out there targeting albies. Generally fishing has been good out from Waikanai, and Pekapeka, with fish holding between the 30 to 50 metre mark. Surf casters out here have reported some really good catches, but these guys tend to be pretty hard core and fish sometimes through the night, when the fish move in to feed under cover.
There are always holes and pockets where the fish feed, and you may be able to pick them up at any time, whether it be on an incoming or outgoing tide.  Learning to read the beach is going to give you a better chance at good results.  
Sometimes checking out the location at dead low tide will give you some clues as to where the guts are, and even sign where snapper have been feeding and stirring up the seafloor.
Here’s a couple of pointers on reading beaches:
https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/how-to-read-a-beach
https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/reading-the-beach-sandbars-troughs-and-cuts
Still, this is some of the best snapper fishing I’ve ever seen in Wellington, which is a good sign that this fishery is on the increase.
For surf casting, between Paikakariki and Raumati seems to be the hot area for snapper, for good numbers and good-sized fish, up to 15 pounds.
Heading down towards Pukerua Bay, we’ve been doing really well on snapper fishing the Wairaka Rise recently.  
It’s quite a big reef that covers a couple of kilometres, and you’ll find on the 30 and 50 metre contour line there’s a ridge about 2.4 kilometres off Wairaka Point.  It’s not on a map but if you zoom in on a Navionics map or use your sounder it’s apparent.
Anchoring up and getting a berley pot down there is the way to fire up the fishing. The rise is kind of like a mini-version of Hunter’s Bank, and in fact, it’s often a better bet when the weather is not being nice.
You can also get some really good kingies here, even on jigs whilst still at anchor, and a live bait is always good to get down if you have any.  A nice mackerel might get you a kingy, or a decent snapper, but if you are just after kings a kahawai will do the job if that’s all you can get.
The other place that is also under-rated for kingfish is the south end of Mana.  There are a lot of good fish there and you can even pick them up on normal baits.  But a concerted effort with specialist kingy gear like mechanical jigs or livies will stand a good chance of picking you up a decent fish.
They will hold anywhere from twenty, down to a hundred metres, so there’s plenty of good foul ground to explore.
Because it’s so close, this area often gets bypassed in search of wider ‘tiger country’, but it can be very productive if you strike the right conditions and have a good approach.  
The tides can make it quite hard to fish when they are running, but remember, it’s often running water that creates feeding patterns, especially for kingfish and snapper, so sometimes you have to work with the water conditions.  As the tidal flow slows a bit either side of slack, there are good opportunities to make the most of the areas that are commonly unfishable.
Generally, the west coast has been fishing relatively consistently, even though you often have to be patient and work for it.  Makara, Boom, and all down the coast towards Ohau has provided decent catches of snapper, cod, gurnard, terakihi, john dory and trevs.
Vern’s reef has been producing some good trevs too, and recently it’s been fishing really well for terakihi.  It’s pretty well known and gets a lot of pressure, but still seems to produce good fishing.
The south coast has been a bit punished by the winds, putting the swell up and making fishing generally difficult from both boat and shore.
So, getting out wider to the Trench etc has really been mostly for the brave hearted.  There are the usual bluey’s, bass and puka being caught, but the weather looks pretty marginal for out there over the next week or so.

February 26, 2021


Note: If map is showing it is created by LINZ / New Zealand Hydrographic Authority and made available by Creative Commons 3.0. Maps should not be used for navigation
We’re seeing red hot snapper fishing, land based from Paikakariki and Raumati. Big fish and big numbers (caught last two hours leading to low tide at night). If you have a look along the beach at low tide see the channels and guts and holes where fish have been feeding and will hold, so mark your location and then fish it during high tide, particularly at night. Night is when the big success has been happening as the good fish come in under cover of darkness. Mana boat ramp between the two bridges surfcasters caught several really nice snapper again at night. You’ll often get good moki in there too. school snapper in the Porirua harbour entrance , and at this time of the year you can start to get kingies and bigger snapper moving in.
Good fishing! Here’s Mike on the left who works occasionally at my Rongotai shop with his first hapuku. This one south of Mana on the 200mark.
‍
Boat fishing has been a bit up and down with the weather.  Big southerly blows closing down the fishing for a while, but it’s all starting to fire up again now with the northerly flow.
Snapper appear to have come back on strong everywhere again, the harbour, west and south coasts, in close and out wider, so choose whichever way you like to target this species and you’ve got a great opportunity this week.
Some of the kayak guys are landing stunning fish in close to the reef and foul as well.
The Trench is producing a few nice bluenose currently, but puka seem to have been a bit harder.  Anywhere from 150 – 180 metres is a good place to start prospecting, but going further and getting down to 250 plus has produced some bigger fish.
There's a great spot off Baring Head we call ‘bluenose heaven’ that seems to produce well for the people we send there.  Come on into the shop for a chat and we can help you out there.
We’ve had a lot of earthquakes recently, and I suspect that may put the fish off, as it always seems to be this way when the shakes are real local.
The south coast has just become nice and clean over the last few days so it’s perfect for moki and general fishing now.
Kapiti has fished really consistently well for snapper and kingies.  We had the spear fishing champs out there last week and the water was only 14 degrees, but it’s come up a bit again and there is plenty of good fishing to be had.
The forecast really suits Kapiti for the next week straight at this stage, so it’s well worth taking the opening and giving it a good look.
There’s albacore off the back of Kapiti and back towards Mana too.
Ngawi has fished well, even though weather put the handicap on last weeks tournament there are good catches of terakihi, trumpeter, snapper, and monster cod to be had out there.
Weather looks good for the next few days with not much swell or wind by Wellington standards, so the opportunity is there to target whatever your favourite species is pretty much anywhere.

It was firing all over the place last week. There’s plenty of bluenose action out at the Trench. Gemfish and hapuka are also being caught out at the south coast and out towards the Trench, however, they’re a bit quieter out west.
North of Mana is also proving to be quite productive. There’s plenty of tarakihi around in your usual places, that being the 80-100m zone on both coasts.
The snapper fishing has been generally quite good as well; however, it’s a bit patchy around Mana and south of Mana. Around Kapiti and north of Kapiti has been pretty consistent for the snaps.
After this northerly goes, everything should change for the better. So just wait for the swell and winds to die down and we should be in for some good fishing.
Surfcasting wise, it’s been red hot on the south coast. It’s probably some of the best surfcasting that I’ve seen for a long, long time, particularly for blue moki and snapper, but also for blue cod and tarakihi. Lots of kingfish are being caught in the harbour at the moment on both livebaits and topwater – there’s at least one being caught a day.
It’s been exceptionally good shore fishing also for snapper and moki around the coast. For example, a 7.5kg moki was caught off the shore recently, as well as a 10kg snapper. It’s not uncommon for people to catch 3-6 moki in a session from the shore at the moment.
I’ve never seen moki fishing like this, which I think can be put down to a great spawning season and/or the netting ban on the south coast.
The inshore fishing on the south coast is delivering for all the usual species at the moment – blue cod, gurnard, tarakihi, moki and kingfish. Again, the 80-100m mark is proving to be fruitful.
There’s also been a bit of on and off albacore action off the back of Mana and Kapiti as well. Again, when this northerly goes, I’d expect them to come back in a more consistent fashion.
I’d expect the next patch of good weather to bring some of the best fishing of the season.

I can’t believe how good the fishing is in Wellington at the moment. Palliser Bay is on fire and surfcasters and boaties alike are cashing in on some spectacular fishing. When the water is clean it’s dynamite for gurnard, kahawai, snapper and in particular some epic blue moki fishing. The moki action is like I’ve never seen it before. For no apparent reason there just seems to be a big population increase and they are hanging in there. It’s just crazy, and it’s no secret with proverbial picket fences of anglers vying for space on some occasions to get into the fish.
We have novice anglers bagging several decent moki in a single session from the shore, normally you just don’t see that, but long may it continue.
Bait stores are running dry, and we are flat out ourselves delivering bait and berley.
The weather has stopped us, and most of the other boaties, from getting out there on occasion as per usual.


The northerly flows seem to have kicked off some more great snapper action, that had previously gone a bit quiet with the southerlies dominating.  Now these fish appear to be back with a vengeance close in, all up and down the coast by land or by boat.
The albacore tuna are now running strong and have been in easy reach out behind Mana.  We had a customer that caught ten fish last week out behind the island.  It’s the usual story if you are targeting these fish.  Look for any bird activity, breaking surface water or temp/current lines etc and get your small tuna lures through them at around 6 – 7 knots.
Albies are a great eating fish if you get them bled and on the ice.  Check out some more detail here: HOW TO CATCH AND COOK ALBACORE
Puka fishing is pretty good too, and we got a great haul on our last trip off Makara coast
Kingies sheltering up in the lee of Mana from the northerlies.  Hunters and Boom both going well for kings when you can make the most of the limited windows of opportunity the weather allows.  Morning missions have been the best option before the wind gets up too much.
From the shore the kingfish action has been really hot, with slide baiters in Oriental Bay catching fish in good numbers and up to 20kgs!
South coast is just so good recently, and we’ve had some very happy clients getting great results from shore.  We are running land-based charter trips if you want to learn how to surf cast, or just improve your knowledge, or maybe just prefer not to be on a boat.  Ask about prices and schedules at our Rongotai shop and we will gladly talk through the options, there’s been no better time to get into it.

From the shore There’s starting to be a good run of snapper and moki in Palliser Bay now for surfcaster’s. I’ve heard of a few good catches recently. One of my mates got 3 moki and 3 snapper the other day east of lake ferry. Traditional moki spots like longbeach have produced a few good moki as well - a bit closer to home. There’s been a good number of snaps and kingis caught in Evans Bay and also off Ngaranga. Good size snaps to 5-6kg and kings to around 20kg
From the boat
There’s been some great bluenose fishing in the trench but like the snapper around mana, it can be hit and miss.
Puka fishing out west has been similar - good one day, tough the next.
Pukerua Bay has been good for snaps recently fishing around 40metres, and Kapiti has also been performing consistently as well.
We had a run of kingis the other day off the Mana Bridge but places like Boom, Hunters and Kapiti have been a safer bet for kings.
We’ve been getting annoyed by Seven Gill sharks lately at Mana but a good variety of species has been keeping the customers happy on most trips, including john dory, trevally, gurnard, teris and cod and of course kahawai.
Snapper have been rampant for a few days then have been going off the feed a bit. Pretty much business as usual.
Let’s hope for some better weather so we can get out to the hotspots more often. Lately the weather has improved but is still pretty windy.
Have a great Christmas and see you all in the new year.

Good news is that the snapper have arrived back at mana in big numbers. Although it has been very difficult to get out in the wind of late, when you can, it’s been pretty rewarding. From famine to feast, the snapper appear to be everywhere at the moment and are also quite easy to catch. We’ve caught a lot of nice fish even on half-day trips in the last few weeks. We’ve predominantly been fishing the Bridge, where we can get a little more shelter in the northerlies.


‍
If you’re unfamiliar with the Bridge, it’s an area of rise and foul that runs between Titahi Bay and Mana.  It comes up to as shallow as six metres and drops off to twenty, and it’s about 500 metres wide, providing good foul ground to shelter food, terrain to create good current vortexes and it can hold a lot of fish.
A nice plate favorite making a few appearances are the john dory, that often jump on smaller fish hooked on dropper rigs.
Although you can anchor up and berley right on top of the system, it’s often best to fish off the banks where it drops down either side.  Turn of the tide can see some amazing action including snapper, trevs, and kingfish.
The only caviat is that it can be difficult to fish when current is running at full steam, so catching it in the hours either side of the tides is best bet, and at the moment you are virtually guaranteed a good bag if you are fishing the right way.
Snapper will also be running in all the other popular areas up and down the coast, they have just been protected by the conditions stopping us getting out there and having a crack most days recently.
There’s some good weather patterns approaching for next week, so it’s going to be all on I’d say.
Surfcasters have been getting a few good five to six kilo snapper off flat rock, and there have been plenty of kingfish caught off the rocks around Evans Bay and Oriental Parade in the last week.
Moki are still a prime target for surf casters around the south coast with plenty of good specimens being landed.
Out wide puka are still firing big-time, and out at the Trench, in the first fishable day in a while, there were a few bluenose up to 12 kilos landed out there.
Also out wide off Ohau Point in around 300 metres, look for sign in the widespread foul ground. It can be a good place to plug in your electric reels and hit the deep.
Kapiti has been a real struggle to access but there are good snapper there now, and when the conditions allow we expect Kapiti will provide a great opportunity to nab some bigger fish.
The deep areas of foul all around Kapiti lend themselves well to fishing slow jigs, particularly at this time of year when the water temps get the fish a bit more active.
We usually fish the south end simply for convenience as it’s a bit of a steam, and anything from 20 to sixty metres plus over structure or sand seems to produce snapper, gurnard, blue cod, trevally and terakihi.
The channel north of Kapiti in 30 – 50 metres is also a good spot if you can identify fish on the sounder and get into them.
Makara is also going well when the bite is on if you are prepared to make the effort to get there from mana, but often well worth it as the fishing is usually pretty consistent there especially coming into summer.

Pete is still out at sea doing pretty well at the moment. Last week's report is still pretty much where it's at, but here are a few quick updates from on the water today.
The Moki are still running hot in Palliser Bay, and are moving further afield to other places such as Wainui, and the Fitzroy Bays.
Hapuka fishing is really going well off the west coast in around 150 - 170 metres.
Makara and the back of Mana are also fishing well, and check out the 200 - 240 metre zones around Fishermans for puka.

The biggest and most exciting thing for me at the moment is the ‘return’ of the blue moki. It’s been going off, if you wanted to catch some blue moki now is the time. All through Palliser Bay there is great moki fishing, and they are not requiring the greatest of skill to find. Normally moki can be quite fussy and particular about where they hang, sticking to specific areas where foul meets sand or structure, but at the moment they seem to be everywhere out there, happily schooling out over the sand allowing even novice fishermen to catch several in a trip from the shore.


It’s the best moki fishing I have seen in a long while, and there are some really nice sized specimens up around 5kg being caught.
There are a few spotty sharks frequenting the same area, and I had my rod buckled out of it’s spike by a decent one.  They certainly can give you a good go and a bit of sport if that’s your thing.
Moki fishing should hold steady for a while now, especially off Palliser and further around to White Rock, so if you are a keen land based fisho, this is a rewarding species to target when you get onto them.
Snapper fishing seems to have buttoned off a bit after a great season all year.  There are still some good fish north and south of Kapiti, still holding in the deeper water 50 – 60 metres, and often the big ones will move in towards Tanimoana at this time of year.
Otherwise it’s been a bit slim-pickings around Wellington on the snapper for us, with Mana and south of Mana not really firing.
The terakihi have also been a bit short in supply as well, but this can often change just as quickly for the better around the Wellington region.
Kingfish are going well though, around the reef systems at Kapiti in particular.
The puka are also back on form, and Fisherman’s would be a great go-to at the moment.
There’s good reports from the south coast, the trench and also Palliser for puka, which is pretty standard for this time of year.
As soon as the weather opens up a window, get on out there, the fishing should be awesome.
Pop in and pick up some of the fresh crayfish and skipjack burley I’ve been making up.  It’s a messy business putting these together but you know the fish love it.

Right now, on a Friday afternoon I am sheltered up on the north end of Mana in 25 knots. It’s fishable out wider but uncomfortable! The harbour is fishing pretty well, particularly for gurnard which are naturally an awesome eating fish even though not much sport. The south coast is starting to calm down, and out west is fishable and looking ok if you are happy to shelter up in the lee of Mana or other areas of coastline. The swell on the south coast is supposed to ease to half a metre so it should be pretty good if that happens over the next few days.
There’s a few whitebait still around, and if the water clears enough should be good on the moki off the south and east coast.
There is usually a pretty good run of big snapper between Kapiti and Foxton around this time and over the next month traditionally.
Fisho’s make a beeline from Te Horo to Tangimoana with kontikis and kayaks, or whatever it takes to get amongst it, so I expect this will happen again as the snapper fishery has been very healthy this year.
Even though we are seeing the usual spring run of snapper, and kingies being caught off Hunter’s etc, the real highlight is the spring run of gurnard that make great table fare and are in great size and numbers at the moment.
In the harbour there are a lot of gurnard off Evan’s Bay and Ward Island, and down toward the harbour entrance.  Point Journingham and Point Halswell are also great spots to try from both boat and land. Off the south coast Fitzroy Bay and Lyall Bay are also good options for chasing carrots and they tend to be a bit deeper here, like 20 to 30 metres.  
To target gurnard, usually anywhere off the sand in 15 to 20 metres is the best go-to, and although they can be picked up often on lures, fishing with good quality fish bait like skippy, is the best way to get good results.
Gurnard are a colourful looking butterfly of a fish, and they equally like a nice colourful bait, which is why fancy flasher rigs and lumo beads are often employed with great success by gurnard fisho’s.
To be fair, they are pretty easy to catch on a bog standard, simple dropper rig, and there’s always the chance of picking up kahawai, trevs, teri’s, and snapper as by-catch.
If you are not having any luck on the droppers, try a running rig that pins the bait a bit harder to the bottom where the gurnard feed.
I’ll often anchor up off Point Gordon, and swing back and forth picking up cod, teris, and gurnard as the boat swings back and forth across the edge of the foul turning to sand.
Weather looks a bit iffy this weekend, but there are some good days coming end of next week so see you out there.

A pretty cracker weekend last weekend, there were some good snapper caught, including a few over the magic twenty-pound mark. On one hand the conditions and fishing was tough, because of the dirty water and big tides, but it was nice and fishable with not much wind, so plenty of anglers were able to have a good crack at what was around, and with every man and his dog out, there were some great fish caught.
West was best conditions-wise, but there was no shortage of hardy souls braving the south coast and getting out to the Trench and even further afield such as Steven’s Passage.
Inshore, a lot of terakihi. Cod and snapper were caught which is always to be expected as a staple in Wellington.
The harbour goes well in the big tides as there’s not so much negative affect from the water movement, so when the big tides are running it can actually even be better for moving your berley more effectively.  The harbour is also fishing pretty well for most species including snapper.
Surf casters have been going crazy on the kahawai in the harbour, as these fish are still carving up whitebait and seem to be around in good numbers.
Kingies up to twenty kilos were caught out at Hunter’s
It’s the Wellington Surf Casters club comp this weekend, and with some very strong nor-westers the south coast, and White Rock in particular will be getting a caning.
With wind up to 40 knots forecast, there won’t be much boating going on, but surf casters off the south coast will be in their element.
This week you might sneak out Saturday morning, but Sunday to Tuesday, it’s a good time to re rig all the gear, get some chores done, stock up with bait and be ready to go once the big front passes through.

Wellington Harbour By boat - Some nice snapper, gurnard and trevs have been caught recently from Pt Halswell to Falcon Shoal as well as south and western sides of Ward Island. The edge of the shipping channel and around the harbour entrance have been going well for big bluecod, gurnard and kahawai Shore based - It's nice to see the return of the kahawai, along with whitebait, pretty much all over the harbour at different times and days. Evans Bay has been particularly busy with kahawai schooling up from the Coastguard building along to Cobham drive and over to Miramar wharf. There's been a nice spring run of gurnard at places like Greta Pt (Niwa) and various other points around the bay as well.
South coast
By boat - Good cod and teris from 40mtr down to 100mtr at most reefy spots.
As a general rule, Karori is better for the bluecod, and Turakerei is better for the teris along with other places like Baring head, the Wreck, around the marine reserve and the Airport reef.
Fitzroy bay is a nice calm spot for a feed of cod, teri, gurnard and trevally. Its particularly good if conditions are a big rough out wide.
Shore based - Kahawai, the odd nice bluecod, gurnard and trevally are around places like Fitzroy bay, Wainui, Pencarrow while White rock and 'the Spit' are a good bet for spotty sharks, a possible moki or elephantfish and a general mixed bag of other ooglies.
West Coast
By boat - Still some puka getting caught off Makara and Ohau but the bigger ones are harder to get at this time of the year due to spawning.
There's been some good schools of warehou around place like Boom, Ohau, Hunters and Fishermans. Snapper are biting better in the deeper water (over 50mtrs) but there are still some shallower ones especially from Pukerua bay northwards.
Plenty of kingis have been hooked out at Hunters bank lately.
It’s been quite productive over the last two winters but of course not every day. The fish tend to be a bit deeper in the winter (50-70mtr).
Kapiti - Better snapper fishing in the 50+ mtr areas. good tarakihi on the south end and still
Kingis on the North.
Durville - Big snapper and Kingi time at Stephens passage (80-120mtr)
Surf casting
It's a good time to target tarakihi, tervally and warehou on the shingle beaches from Titahi bay down to Ohau pt. The odd snapper may still be on the cards.
Palliser Bay Swellmap for the weekend ahead looking good
‍
With the strong North – west winds dominating Palliser bay and the south east coast could be the smart spots to fish this week if you’re keen

The surfcasters are happy at the moment, because it’s whitebait season. That doesn’t mean that they will be downsizing their hooks, it means that the kahawai are on the chew, especially in close around any of the river mouths, estuaries, or any places inshore that they can herd these little baitfish. Fishing from shore with small spinners is a great way to have some fun on light gear, and any small shiny lure or even little soft baits can provide epic action. Back in the day we used to throw the ¼ oz Stingsilda around, who’s out there that’s old enough to remember those classic weapons ;-)


You’ll see a few hopefuls out with their nets in the river inlets hoping for a few grams of river gold that are certainly a delicacy when generously spooned into a pan with the fritter mix.
All the big species are fishing well at the moment, plenty of big puka, bluenose, snapper, terakihi, cod and kingies coming from all around the usual popular spots we talk about in our reports.
It’s good to see the puka fishing pick up from a few weeks ago off the west coast too.  Some really good results in both size and numbers coming in from the popular 150 to 200 metre mark, and puka fishing out at the Trench and beyond is still going really well.
Snapper have been steady for this time of year mostly out deeper in 70 – 80 metres, but you’ll still find them in closer to shore.  The kayak fishermen do really well with soft baits in close, and winter is a good time to use the bigger seven inch patterns moved nice and slow for the big fish.  Big Zman and Catch livie bodies go well in either natural or orange colours.  Otherwise it can be good stray lining or casting whole pillies into the wash for the win.
There’s truckloads of kingies out at Hunters still, and generally jigs are firing them up so it’s worth a crack out there.
Also off the south coast just on the edge of the Trench where there are bluenose has been producing some nice kings too.
This weekend looks wicked, particularly Sunday, for fishing the south coast by boat of from the shore, with a light north-east wind and not much swell.  High tide around 09.00 so perfect for a morning shot at the Trench either side of the tide perhaps.

It’s been a fantastic run of winter weather here in the balmy capital, with three good weekends in a row and packed boat ramps. Sure enough the fishing has also been worth the wait with some really good results from around the Wellington region, particularly off the south coast. There’s been a big influx of Puka out of the south coast, and deep dropping the Trench and beyond appears to have been far more productive than the west coast.
Here's the winning photo from our recent comp. Shaun Rankin at Kapiti with his trusty 12' tinnie. Shaun also managed 3rd longest snapper winning a Kiwi Sizzler gas barbecue for his effort. Nice One.
‍
We have had some good intel from one of our commercial operator customers about some great puka and bluenose fishing spots that are out about twice as far as the Trench.
I’m happy to elaborate a bit more on precisely where these spots are if you pop in to see me in person at the shop.
Another commercial operator we know well is pretty impressed by the number of fish out there at the moment, and the general state of the Hapuka fishery.  They believe the fish may be moving around a lot more than people give them credit for.  They are also not necessarily glued to structure, but will venture out onto the sand a fair distance, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the sounder and possibly continuing a drift a little further than normal off the main foul ground if you have not hooked up.
Especially at this time of year prior to spawning, the fish can be quite mobile, so if they are not at old favourite spot X, they may well be out further on the sand.  
Recreational anglers are also picking up good fish on jigs at the moment too, up to around 30 kilos.
The puka are heading deeper, and it can be 300 metres down, so fishing the turn of the tide is important as that’s the only window that will allow lines to stay vertical in the current.
Good numbers of bluenose are also being caught, in fact, they are bloody near everywhere out by the Trench at the moment.
There are even a few kingies out deep too, often just grabbing baits as a by catch, so keep the jigs handy and it’s well worth having a go for puka and kings with a good big jig in lumo patterns.
Snapper fishing has been ok, with more individual fish than big schools.  Although the odd good moocher will always be caught in close, often picked up by the kayak anglers or surf casters, most of the good snapper fishing has been out deep in around 70 – 80 metres, but even out to 120 off the west coast, in all the usual reef structures and popular areas such as off Boom down to Ohau etc.
Having said that, Fisherman’s appears to have gone a bit quiet, but that can always change.  If you are hitting it with no luck it’s probably best to move on fairly quickly to another area.
The usual staples of blue cod, trevs and terakihi have all been pretty easy to pick up in general fishing, so getting a feed out there is pretty much a given.  In any weather or wind direction there’s always somewhere around the coastline to pick up these species.  Heres a tip or two if you are chasing the teri’s  https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/how-to-catch-tarakihi-pete-lambs-top-tips
Snapper are one of those fish that can turn up out of nowhere and there’s always a great story like this one.  Check out this 23 pound fish bagged off the Plimmerton Wharf in the middle of the day!  Amazing catch, and just the sort of thing that keeps us living in hope whenever there is a line in the water.

Here's an update after the comp last weekend. The fishing situation has not changed much in a week: Another successful annual fishing comp due to all entrants, my staff, all the generous sponsors and the great Wellington weather! Thanks also to Parrot Dog bar in Lyall bay for an excellent prize giving venue. Everyone who turned up got prizes which was pretty cool! We had 102 entrants fishing over the weekend with 54 boaties, 36 shore anglers, 7 juniors and 5 kids. It was surprising that only 2 kahawai were measured, no blue moki and no kids catches measured...... The snapper wern't biting as well as they have been recently but the blue cod, tarakihi and gurnard fishing was pretty good. I heard there were a heap of kingis caught out west up to an impressive 28kg on the weekend. Hot off the press today - the bluenose are firing at the trench. Well done to all the winners.
Nice one Trev!
‍
We’ve been out quite a bit over the last couple of weeks, making the most of our weather windows and picking up some good fish.
This snapper season has been undoubtedly one of the best the Wellington region has seen in recent years, and they are still being caught in good sizes and numbers.
Although there will always be big residential moochers in the shallows, sheltering in the weed and foul, it appears that most of the fish have moved out deeper now to around 70 metres.
In particular, Vern’s reef has been producing really good fish.  Traditionally a good terakihi spot, it’s been turning up some very nice snapper and trevs lately, again in 70 to 80 metres.
In fact, most of the west coast has been returning some solid results, with the southerly swells rendering the south coast a bit lumpy and tough to get out to the Trench comfortably, the west coast has been a good option from Ohau right up past Kapiti.
Hunter’s has seen some great fishing, and the kayak boys have been pulling several double figure snaps out from Pukerua Bay.
The kingy fishing has also been good, and there are great specimens right in shallow at the moment.  We recently put a young lad onto a king that pushed his limits, and with a bit of help from dad he pulled a 15kg fish out of 10 metres just in behind Mana Island.
We also got stuck into some blue mackerel fishing the likes of which I’ve never seen previously, with big fish up to 3 kgs taking most anything on offer.  That’s a meaty sized mackerel for the smoker or to be thrown straight back over as live-bait for kingies.
Speaking of live bait, this method is the best ever for catching john dory, and the JD fishing has really started firing up now.  Targeting john dory also gives you the chance of scoring a decent snapper or kingy, so it’s often worth the effort.
For a bit more detail on how to catch them check this video article: https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/how-to-catch-john-dory-and-why
The other favourite eating fish that has been firing up is the old blue cod, and the cod fishing on the west coast recently has just been outstanding.
Perhaps it was the massive southerly activity that was bad enough to cancel the ferries, that has forced the blue cod around the corner to the west coast up as far as the Makara Fenceline.  The big cod are turning up all over the place, including in the harbour. We had some absolutely epic cod fishing last week off the fenceline, with cod up to 3 kilos running like kahawai.  Pelagic cod! Didn’t get a jump or tail-walk out of them but they were great in the old frypan.

There are still plenty of good winter snapper being caught, we have had most of our good fishing and reports from up Kapiti way recently. The weather, particularly from the south, has put the usual fisherman-limiter on us.
It is pretty typical to expect some rough stuff in July, but there are plenty of short windows, usually mid-week to be had if you can grab them.
Our recent run to top up the local store’s bait supplies showed us how few anglers had been out!
We have seen lots of snapper coming from Kapiti, including some big ones, taking both jigs and baits.
Usually in winter, a good berley trail is often the thing that makes all the difference, but that is by no means a rule, and drifting with kabura and Inchiku style jigs can really pull some great fish particularly in the deeper reaches 50 metres plus.
Kapiti fishes pretty well off all its coasts, and it’s really just a matter of finding the best side as suits the weather and tidal conditions at the time.
There’s always a good chance of big snapper after a solid blow, so heading out to Kapiti is a good option to try for them, or pick up a decent feed of cod and terakihi at least.
There’s a few puka around too if you are out a bit deeper.

Inshore fishing is pretty good on the whole at the moment, and better than this time last year for snapper. Plenty of terakihi, trevs, snapper, and kingfish still around the local inshore fishery including the harbour. In fact, just last week out on my little Mac off Point Gordon it was fairly easy to get a good boat load of terakihi, snapper and gurnard in just 20 metres. West coast and harbour has been the place to be, with the southerly swell roughing up the south coast a bit much.
Out west snapper are still prevalent in shallow around the structure, out off the sand and even out deep.  Brilliant season.  Use a good bit of berley when you find a decent spot and that should get them on the chew usually, although drifting with lures such as soft baits or kabura style jigs is also well worth a crack.
The full moon last week made it a little tougher, but that has passed now and there should be some great fishing coming up over the next week or so.
Right now it’s puka ‘season’ so to speak as they are in roe and in prime condition.
This does raise the argument that we should be leaving them a bit to spawn for the future, but in reality if we all manage our take and don’t get too greedy there will be plenty of fish for the long term.  A puka is a big unit and you don’t need more than one per person to make a bloody substantial feed, and have some left for the freezer.
Puka spots to explore are just north and just south of Fisherman’s.  Just take some time to look for the fish and when it fires it really fires.
Just out behind Mana Island can also be good if you can spot some little features in about 135 metres.  It doesn’t take much structure at all to hold fish, so spend a bit of time looking for the rewards and mark your spots for a quicker job next time.
Heading out wider you need to be looking in 200 -300 metres for your sign.
The Trench is starting to fish well for bluenose when you can get out, and a few guys that come into the shop are doing better pushing it a little bit deeper.  Electric reels and decent braid means there are a lot of good spots yet to be found out there in all that bottom detail.
Sunday looks like a pretty good day to get out there at this stage, or give us a bell in the shop if you’re keen to join us on a charter to see how we go about it first-hand.

I’ll tell you what! The snapper fishing here in Wellington is as good as I have ever seen it anytime, including the height of summer. They are everywhere. The surfcasters are getting them, the boaties are getting them off every coast, it’s a really exciting prospect for the fishery to see this popular fish in such decent numbers here. It’s incredible, no matter where we fish we are getting juvenile snapper, good pannies, and more than the occasional big banger.
A local surf caster got his limit from the shore over the weekend, fishing the beaches from Paekakariki north, with fish up to 8.5 kilograms.
Night fishing is proving very successful, with at least two fish over the magic twenty-pound mark caught last week that we know of.
Out on the boat we have been exploring new spots in behind Mana Island with great results, by getting in close, as shallow as 20 metres sometimes, it’s surprising what good fish are in there when the conditions are favourable with not too much tide.
Even though all the common reefs and popular areas are fishing well, it just goes to show that sometimes it pays to try something new and take the gamble that a bit of patience will pay off.
The kingies are still around too, and land based anglers are commonly landing them on everything from lures, cut baits and livies.


The usual reefs are producing nice kings for the boaties as well.  Check out this 31kg beast caught by John Crawford on the south end of Mana.  The usual spots such as Hunter's and Fisherman's are also producing good results.
‍
Kev from KP marine with an epic bluefin tuna catch
For the more adventurous, Kev, from KP Marine, landed a 60kg southern bluefin tuna out wide from Cape Palliser.  If you are keen on a bit of that action, you could launch at Ngawi.   Kev reckons there are more out there and is heading out again for another go this weekend.
He has his own shop http://www.kpmarine.co.nz/fishing
One thing we have found a bit harder is the puka fishing.  Despite everything else going well we’ve had a lot of feedback that chasing bluenose and puka out at the trench has not been great.  I’m sure they are there but it might take a bit more prospecting to find them.

What a great weekend it was for fishing just past. It doesn't look as good this coming weekend but hopefully it will change. With northerlies forecast the south coast and harbour should be ok particularly for surfcasting and rockfishing. The snapper have been a bit harder to catch recently and the deeper spots - 50 to 70mtrs have been more productive. There's still been good action in close but not in the same numbers as the last few weeks. The southerlies havn't helped much as they reduce the water temp and put some fish off the feed.
Kapiti - the 50-60mtr mark has been better for snapper.
A few albacore tuna have been but certainly not in big numbers. The hapuku fishing has been pretty good apparently.
West - There's been plenty of gemfish at the 78 metre rise and a few puka too.
Fisherman's has been a bit quiet but north of Fisherman's has been better fishing.
Snapper and trevally have been more consistent down towards Ohau but there is still the odd good catch from Makara up to Mana.
Many anglers have reported tough fishing but most have been getting a few snapper mixed in with tarakihi, gurnard, trevally and kingfish.
This season there certainly hasn't been as many kahawai around but the ones that are out there are in peak condition prior to spawning. Tarakihi fishing has been pretty good at spots like Verns, Makara fencline and the south end of Kapiti
Harbour - Just south of Ward island (6-8mtrs) has been good for snapper of late with some good trevs and gurnard too.
Kingfish out in 15-20 mtrs at Ward have been around as well.
The kingis have been a bit harder to catch off the shore in the harbour and many have gone deeper. Point Gordon, the Wreck and Falcon Shoal are generally good for kingis at this time of the year.
Point Halswell and Jenningham are great in a southerly for gurnard, tarakihi and a mixture of other species (20mtrs).
There have been a lot of smaller kahawai around the harbour this season, which make great kingie live baits.

Have you ever heard of a butterfly tuna? Also known as a butterfly mackerel, there have been several of these very unusual fish caught this week out off the west coast among the albacore. Imagine a cross between a tuna, a tarpon, and a kingy and that is sort of what you have. A bizarre species that is certainly an eye opener at the boat. These fish grow up to 40 plus kgs, but the specimens we’ve been seeing a bit more modest. The most distinguishing features are the large silver scales, unusual to tuna, and the flattened head profile .
The unusual Butterfly Tuna.  Check out those scales
‍
Actually a member of the mackerel family, these fish are absolutely delicious pan fried crumbed, floured, battered or grilled.
Albacore have been about in great numbers recently, and out west from Ohau upwards they are right in close as shallow as 60 metres, so watch out for sign of them under the boat, or just have a troll with some small tuna lures.
Just off Ohau point has been the hot spot for these.
Otherwise the fishing has been put down a little bit by the bout of southerlies dropping the water temp again.
Around Mana and Pukerua Bay the fishing has been running a bit up and down, so it’s anyone's guess at the moment when you head out that way.
The weather forecast this weekend is pretty good, with winds from the north offering opportunity off the south coast.
We’ve found it better offshore than right in close mostly, but generally all the good areas like Hunter’s, Fisherman’s, the Trench etc are fishing pretty nicely on most occasions so it’s a matter of getting a bait in the water.
Good luck for the week. Perhaps go see if you can score yourself a butterfly tuna :-)

A pretty good looking weekend ahead, choice!! A good forecast is in store for Wellington for this weekend coming up particularly late Saturday through today until Monday, best day Sunday with seven knot variables on the cards. Mid-week goes a bit pear shaped, but it looks to be clearing up again for the following weekend too, finally a bit of cooperative timing for the nine to fivers.
At the moment fishing is all go with pretty much every common species being caught in good numbers and pretty consistently at the moment.
There has even been marlin seen at Tora and Terawhiti recently.
West Coast
There are plenty of tuna out wide from Kapiti, so this could be a great opportunity to get out and target the little speedsters for the table, and search for a few puka marks while you’re on the move out deeper.
The KP marine tuna comp winning albie weighed almost 13 kgs so that’s a great fish on light gear.
Check out this article for a bit of albacore inspiration:
https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/how-and-where-to-catch-fillet-and-cook-albacore
Boom rock and Makara have been producing good terakihi and trevally in around the 20-40 metre mark, as well as fishing pretty good for snapper on occasion, both from boat and surf casting.
Out wider off the west, Hunter’s has been fishing well and the warehou have been making an appearance again.  
This week should be a great opportunity to target Kapiti, Fisherman’s, Hunters, or even take the opportunity to get down to Ohau.  
It’s great conditions for puka dropping on Sunday with dead high tide at 09.50 so good fishing window is from 08.00 until lunchtime.
The kahawai have been in short supply but the ones were getting are very fat and getting ready to spawn, so if you are keeping a few for the smoker the extra fat will add to the taste.
An avid bait fisherman, I am slowly seeing the ways of the lure working well, and I got my first Wellington gurnard on a lucanus the other day (my 2nd fun fishing trip this year!).
Snapper are commonplace up and down the coast, and the surf casters are getting into some good ones now as well.
Kingfish (and puka) are getting caught at all the usual haunts - Hunters, 78, Fishermans, back of Mana, Makara and Ohau.  
There’s some really good sized cod coming out of Mana at the moment too, if you like that for the pot.
‍
South Coast
There is good bluenose and gem fish turning up from the trench, plenty of snapper off the airport reef and Red Rocks. You’ll always find plenty of cod and teri’s at all the usual haunts there as well.
‍
Inner Harbour
We’ve seen some good catches of land based game kingi action out at Sunshine Bay.
There’s also nice kings and snapper off Point Gordan and Ward Island.

Decent weather windows mean some pretty good fishing for us here in the capital. We have had some big tides accompany the full moon, which can be ok for fishing, but tends to push too much water around in deeper spots or areas prone to current. Expect these to calm down as the moon passes into its next phase. Good news is that in shallow where the current has less effect is going great guns at present. Snapper in particular are on fire at the moment, especially in shallower up the west coast. The further north the better it seems, and it’s a great time to chuck a surf caster if you like it land based.
We’re predicting limit bags, and 20lbers are always on the cards when the snapper fishing is this good. Fishing on the sand or reef (25 -70mtrs) will produce fish with the help of ground bait or slow drifting over hotspots. There's been a lot of small ones (1-2kg) around Mana and down to Boom Rock, with bigger ones (3-5kg) north of Pukerua Bay. Slow jigs have been working well as well as bait and berley.
On the south coast the airport reef and east of Sinclair head (35-45mtrs) have been producing some nice snapper and occasionally in good numbers too.
Surfcasters fishing Palliser Bay, the inner harbour, and out west, have generally had some really good results catching nice snapper around the 7-8kg mark.  
It's prime time for the coast north of Fisherman's Table Restaurant to start firing off the shore for snapper if anyone's keen.  If you don’t have any luck you know where to go for dinner at least ;-)
Tuna time is here, and albacore are getting caught out wide from Kapiti and Hunters at present. The water temp is around 19-20 degrees where the albies are hanging out.  These fish are not called the chicken of the sea for nothing, and their delicate pale flesh makes for awesome eating either smoked, or seared in thick medallions leaving them uncooked in the middle.  
Hapuku spots often have albacore around them at this time of the year so it’s worth having some tuna lures in your kit, and slow trolling around at 6-7 knots while you look for some decent Hapuka sign.
On that, we found some awesome puka out west in around 160 – 180- metres zone, but head out to more like 200+ if you are heading south towards Ohau and have a look around for some blips on the sounder.  Last time we were out we found a classic ‘puka-pyramid’ where they are stacked up on top of one another and almost looked like structure.  Mark it fast! If you can get down on that results are pretty much a sure thing.
For puka and the other deepwater species such as bass and bluenose, the trench is fishing pretty well when you can get out, particularly for bluenose. Good numbers of small to medium fish south of Baring head with bigger ones on the far side spots.  If the weather or conditions are really good, head to the far side of the trench and get adventurous, there are some good fish that bit past the usual more popular marks.
The back of 5 mile (woba) has bass on it and the gemfish and tope have been common by catch at most spots.
Most spots are producing good fish at present on the turn of tide. We have been fishing Makara and Ohau with good results lately but I hear Fishermans, the sth Mana patch, 78mtr rise and other spots are firing on and off.
Terakihi and other species - out west These places have gone well for us - Boom rock (50-70mtr) Makara (25mtr), Verns (70mtr) and south of the bridge (40mtr).
Kingfish - it’s going well in the harbour for land based anglers. Lures, live and dead baits have all been producing fish up to 20kg over the last week. Live mackerel and slidebaiting have been the best method and all these places have produced good fish up to around 20kgs recently - Oriental bay, Sunshine bay, Greta point & Flat rock.
In the boat places like Hunters, north end of Kapiti, Aeroplane Island, Fisherman's, Wiraka rise, Ohau and Boom, plus Ward Island, the Wreck, Point Halswell, Jenningham and Barrett’s Reef should all produce good kingfish at this time of the year.
If you want to catch a kingi, use your heaviest tackle with a good drag and put a livie or or two out, tow a Rapala or get into some mechanical jigging or topwater action.  My point is that you have to target these fish with firm intention if you are serious about getting good results.
Inner harbour - if the weather’s good Ward island has been good for kingis, snaps, trevally, gurnard and kahawai. Around the leading light is a good place to start. Point Gordan (20mtrs) is always worth a crack as well as Falcon Shoal. Point Jenningham and Halswell in 20mtrs are good southerly spots
Surfcasters have been doing well on snapper and there has been a few moki around, but kahawai and gurnard are the mainstay for shore fishers particularly in the harbour.

Weather What a windy period we are just coming out of. It’s looking light-ish wind from this Wednesday to Friday so get ready for a few good days out on the water. With northerlies on Saturday and southerlies on Sunday on the forecast, there will be plenty of opportunities to wet a line off the shore and then boat. This time of the year anything can happen.
1. Albacore should be around the 100mtr + marks out west and south. Hapuku spots often have albacore around them at this time of the year so it’s worth having some tuna lures in your kit.
2. Puka, bass and bluenose - the Trench is fishing alright when you can get out. Particularly in bluenose. Good numbers of small to medium fish south of Baring head with bigger ones on the far side spots.
The Woba has bass on it and the gem fish and tope have been common by catch at most spots.
Puka fishing out west is good.
Most spots are producing good fish at present on the turn of tide. We have been fishing Makara - Ohau with good results lately and it’s been quick to come in for snapper and tarakihi which are around in good numbers.
3. Snapper - they are pretty much widespread up and down the west coast now. limit bags and 20lbers should be reported soon I’m picking. Fishing on the sand or reef (25 -70mtrs) will produce fish with the help of Berley or slowing drifting over hotspots.
On the south coast the airport reef and east of Sinclair Head (35-45mtrs) have been producing nice snapper and good numbers occasionally.
Surfcaster’s in Palliser bay, the harbour and out west have all had good results of snapper with 3-4 fish around 7-8kg caught last weekend off the shore.
4. Tarakihi and other species - out west it’s been boom rock (50-70mtr) makara (25mtr), verns (70mtr) and south of the bridge (40mtr) which have been good mutilple species - JDs, trevs, warehou, bluecod and gurnard.
5. Kingfish - it’s going well in the harbour for land based anglers. Lures, live and dead baits have all been producing fish up to 20kg over the last week. Live mackerel and slidebaiting have been the best method and all These places have produced good fish up to around 20kgs recently - oriental bay, sunshine bay, Greta Point, Flat Rock.
In the boat places like Hunter’s, north end of Kapiti, Aeroplane Island, Fishermans, Wiraka Rise, Ohau and Boom Rock, plus Ward Island, the Wreck, Point Halswell, Journingham and Barrera Reef could all produce numbers of kingfish at this time of the year.
If you want to catch a kingi, use your heaviest tackle with a good drag and put a live or or two out.

Fishing is just one of those things that goes up and down, some with factors we know about like full moon, temperatures and tidal run, and some factors that will forever remain a mystery affecting the way our favourite target species behave. Spots that fish hot one day are almost dead the next at the moment, but luckily there are a few areas that are more consistent and that is where it pays to start. We can never expect every day to be grouse for fishing but that’s why we love it. With a line in the water anything is possible, and just like gamblers we all roll the dice waiting for the good times to roll our way.
What we do know is that a big run of southerly weather generally has an adverse effect on the Wellington fishery, delivering swells and rough conditions to the strait, and the south coast, whilst dropping water temps and subsequently also cooling the bite.
We’ve certainly had the southerlies, and that has put the focus of most fishermen to the west coast, which has continued to produce some nice fish albeit in patches.
Anniversary weekend last week just about cleaned out all our bait stock, so there were a lot of fishos out there doing it, even though we found the fishing a bit on the hard side.  
We found some good terakihi and puka fishing off Boom Rock and Makara, but our usual favourite spots around Pukerua Bay and Mana have proven to be patchy at best, especially for snapper.
A north west forecast for the next week will be very welcome, as it should bring the warmer sea temps back to these areas and really fire up the bite, so expect some great fishing in the next couple of weeks.
Snapper fishing further north up the Kapiti Coast has been pretty solid, and there are good fish right in to 5 metres, so this should only get better with warmer water.
This will also apply to the east coast of Wellingtons outer fishing limits, where albacore tuna are there to be caught out from Tora, as well as a few sightings of broadbill.
The south coast is doing it pretty tough after the recent weather, and we don’t really have a lot to report from that way given the lack of traffic, but there are certainly good fish there, including some bluenose up to 20kgs that have been boated by those who have the wherewithal to get out there.
Over the next week I’d be focused on the west coast and targeting puka, kingies and terakihi.
Kingy fishing has been great, both from boat and from shore.  The slide baiters are getting some fantastic catches with fish around 20 kgs plus off Eastbourne.  Grab your livies off the local wharves first, and head to the coast with your aerated baitfish ready for action.  Here’s a little bit of info on this method in action from our Aussie mates ….https://www.nzfishingworld.co.nz/posts/slide-baiting
If you are looking for kingies from a boat, Hunter’s is just a never ending kingy factory at present, so head out there with jigs and live baits and in 30 – 50 metres off the main pinnacles you should be good.
Surf casting off Ocean Beach and Lake Ferry is improving with snapper starting to be picked up here on a consistent basis.  With the northwest arriving there’s no better time to get off here or, in fact, anywhere along the Palliser Bay coast.

Happy New Year! Even though we are experiencing a lot of wind, the upside is that once you do get out there, the water temp is nice and warm, and the fishing is generally pretty good It doesn’t always mean the fishing is going to be easy but if you do your homework or know the good areas to fish you should catch a good feed at this time of the year.
If you're enjoying these reports, there's always more we can talk to you about in person.
Here at the shop, I’m happy to help you out with more detail around the good spots and techniques etc. Drop me an email petelamb2@gmail.com or text on 0274439750 or feel free to Facebook message me.
I’m also running plenty of charters and have space during the week and on weekends for individuals and groups coming up, check out our schedule here:

‍
West coast
Snapper and kingis are biting all over the place. The frustrating thing is they are full on at a spot one day and you go back the next and they are gone.
Reef areas have been most consistent with us recently particularly the 50-80mtr spots like Boom, Hunters, Verns and various other spots. All of species are getting caught - trevs, JDs, gurnard, tarakihi, bluecod, albacore, snaps and kings are all there.
There are a ton of gemfish also turning up, so if you like eating these rich oily fish, west is best right now.
Harbour
It’s been kingi mayhem off oriental and sunshine bays for slide-baiters of late. There were 30 rods out the other morning for 12 kingis caught.
Other places worth putting out live baits and throwing out lures are - Greta Point (NIWA) and points north of there, flat rock, Point Halswell, scorching bay point, Breaker Bay, Seatoun, Lowry bay point
Snapper are also fairly common for boat and shore anglers but not as good as our west.
South coast
Snapper and kingis have been around from the airport reef out to the 50mtr wreck.
Trumpeter and puka have been caught on the 100mtr mark from Sinclair to Karori.
Bluenose are still going well out from homes rock.

Into summer now and it’s 17.5 degrees warm in the water. That means fish get active and we are seeing plenty of that. Heaps of snapper and kings in all usual haunts you would expect to find them. That is, where they are usually supposed to be, but often are not, they are now  Weather always up and down but fishing pretty good when you can get out as per usual.
We have a young customer who is a keen jigger, and to be keen on mechanical jigging you generally want to at least feel young, and he caught a 30kg specimen last week.  That’s a lot of kingy and must have gone pretty good.  They generally fight harder on a jig, perhaps it’s the lead rod banging about their head, but 65 pounds in the old books is a bloody good fish anywhere.
Snapper wise, good numbers all down the west coast moving in nice and close now.  If you are doing most things right, you should be into snapper all the way from Ohau up to Waikanae coast.
That will please the surf casters who have been getting a few good early season moochers between Waikanai and Te Horo.
It’s been pleasing to see the teri’s turning up again now.  We’ve found them a bit scratchy this year, but now they seem to be back on the bite.
Out wide has been rough conditions wise, but last time we got out the fishing was great.  Puka are around but the bluenose are fishing better, with some great hauls out of the Trench.
South coast has been a winner for snapper with Owhiro performing pretty well and some good fishing also off the airport reef systems.  We have it on good authority that these spots are firing so could well be worth a look over the holidays.
As we predicted the kingies have moved in close and we are now seeing the slide baiters and surf casters hooking and landing some nice fish from shore.
Sunshine Bay, and downtown Oriental Bay seem to be the action stations for this, and the boatie brigade are getting kings in the harbour as well.
There are a lot of juvenile snapper around which is a bit out of the ordinary.  Hopefully this means there are greater numbers spawning and we are in for a bit of a snapper bonanza in the next few years.  Wouldn’t that be nice?
South coast is in good nick with the swell ideally dying down a bit for a few fishing windows.  Try and get clear of the murky water if you can, and move out until you see some decent visibility.

Despite some howling winds, there are a lot of positives to be taken out of this week when it comes to the fishing. Before the big blow we had some good action, and there is likely more to come in the next week or so. Hapuka are back on the chew and some good numbers have been taken from both out west and south out in the Trench, so it looks to be gearing up already for a bumper season if we are lucky.


You don’t have to travel too far for puka at the moment.  We had some great fishing straight out from Makara, fishing the big shelf that drops off from around 130 –150 metres.  This is a big drop off and you can find puka all the way along it at the moment. I’d say this is the closest puka spot to land in Wellington that is a consistent producer of fish.  We didn’t fish this drop last season, but trying it again last week was surprised at how well it was going.  It just shows that you don’t necessarily need to go all the way to Fisherman’s or Ohau to get good Hapuka action.
We also caught some big terakihi, gemfish and a few tope out off this area so all on board returned home pretty happy.
Of course puka are a big fish and getting one or two on board is usually all you need.  If you limit what you take and then move back in shore to target snapper, cod or other species that keeps the puka population healthy for next time.
We only run several puka trips per season, but if you are keen on targeting this species best get in contact as we are booking out available spaces between now and the end of January pretty quickly.
The moki comp we talked about last week, out at Ngawi, was fished in near perfect conditions and we saw some really good results, with around 300 rods out, and 22 moki weighed in.  Undoubtedly many more were caught and not weighed, possibly as many as 70 – 100 we estimate.  My mate, for example, caught seven fish but only weighed in the two biggest.
Winning fish was just under 5 kilo’s.  A lovely moki.
Cape Palliser is such an awesome spot if you care to make the journey and have an explore.  There were people out there climbing into the water and gathering crayfish, not something you can do in very many places nowadays.  The fishing is awesome from land and by boat,so when the weather allows perhaps get over there and check it out for yourself.
So after that, we had some crazy winds this week, with Wellington making the news again for it’s famous, as yet un-named, wind.  The good news was that this wind was from the north-west, which blows up a storm but generally brings in warmer water, and this, plus all the stirring up of the ecosystem can often mean a really bumper fishing time to follow, especially for snapper.
From what we can tell, the temp of the water has come up in shallow at least, and the results could bode very well for fishing right up the west coast.  Usually you’ll find awesome snapper and kingy action gets pushed in nice and close, and areas like Pukerua Bay, Makara, and the southern coasts of Mana and Kapiti even, could really fire up.
If you can get a day off mid-week, from Monday night to Weds morning looks like a fantastic window, and we are looking very forward to getting out there ourselves.
It might also be a good opportunity to give the Trench a go,as we had reports of some very good bluenose fishing last Saturday, one boat landing 24 fish for their efforts.  There are a lot of smaller fish about, but a bit further, the far side of the Trench in around the 250 metre mark, seemed to produce bigger specimens.
The terakihi have been a bit thin on the ground lately, orat least they have been noticeably harder to catch, however the blue cod are making up for it, turning up in a few places we don’t normally expect to be catching them.
After this big blow we might see the south coast start turning up the great fishing for both these species that we are used to though.
The inner harbour is still fishing well with plenty of gurnard, and the surf casters are regularly catching snapper now.
Snapper will be moving in to Evan’s Bay, and then usually move in around Eastbourne if they follow the traditional pattern.
Out west Pukerua Bay in around 40 – 60 metres, The Bridge,and south of Mana should be producing good snapper now, so let’s hope we are proved right out there in the coming weeks.

There’s big bluenose action out at the trench at the moment. These stalwarts of the deep are always a great catch for the table and we’ve seen some good numbers of nice fish getting caught if you can get the weather and the time off to cooperate with each other.
Bluenose often hang out up off the bottom a bit, so if you see sign sitting up higher than you might expect for puka then it can often be bluenose.  This time of year we expect they will be there for a while so it’s a matter of keeping an eye on the conditions and being ready to go.
Snapper and kingies have come on a bit but at this early stage of summer they are not exactly raging just yet.
Mana and Pukerua Bay are producing good fish but not yet in the big numbers we expect closer to Christmas.
We are now starting to see the south end of Kapiti fishing well too.  It’s been a bit quiet there to date, but good to see some fresh action at one of our better fishing locations. Here you can get good terakihi off the southern contour changes and reefy pins, and off Pinnacle Rock (see map), and also trevally and the odd decent snapper.
With strong north-west winds forecast the weekend looks a bit average for boaties everywhere but close in to the south and east coast.  There’s no swell there at the moment though, and nice clear water so perfect for surf casting and shallower diving missions.
Launching off Owhiro Bay and staying in really close watching out for the marine reserve could be an option, and it shouldn’t take too long to pick up some nice blue cod and terakihi at least.
Five Mile reef is still good for big cod and terakihi in 50 – 75 metres if you fish the turn of tides when there’s not too much current running.
The weather might be a bit uncooperative this week, but when you can get out Sinclair Head to Karori Rock, and out deeper around 80-100 metres there’s a good chance of catching Hapuka and trumpeter.
Trumpeter are a fantastic fish, and they have been appearing in a few spots lately.
Normally they are more of an east coast fish, but we’re seeing them more south now. There’s a good bank out past, and to the south of Nicholson’s Trench where some really nice specimens have been landed.  It’s a huge area between 100 – 150 metres that gives you plenty of options to cruise about with the sounder and pick up sign.
Being at least 10 miles offshore it’s a bit further to travel, but as such, has not had the angling pressure and can therefore produce unexpected results.
Trumpeter are a fantastic looking fish, a bit like a big moki with distinctive horizontal stripes.  They can grow pretty big, up to 25kgs, and they are a great fight and will scrap like a kingfish all the way to the surface.
They make great eating so are a good reward for the effort.
Trumpeter are usually caught on normal puka gear, but have much smaller mouths than the groper family so a smaller sized hook is better.
Out west looks pretty unfishable in the short term, but those that have been able to fish Hunters are being rewarded with some really nice kingfish.  These are mainly on jigs, but of course livies also work well, often a big live bait being responsible for hooking the bigger fish.
South-west of Hunters we hear the 78 metre rise is fishing well for kings.  It’s primarily a well-known puka spot but being a rise with a bit of current running the kings are there too.
Surfcasting
Where they have been catching gurnard the surfcasting crew are now steadily picking up a few snapper in the harbour now at places like Evan’s Bay. Greta point has been good but inconsistent, and it’s supposed to be a good time to be moki fishing at White Rock (even though the surfcasting club did not do so well off Wainui last week).
In case you missed it here’s a bit more detail regarding all the top surfcasting spots around the Wellington region.

It’s spawning time for the snapper between now and early in the new year so they will be moving in closer to do their thing. Many people don’t realise the snapper move in, and when you can find them they tend to feed voraciously and can be quite easy to catch.


FISHING REPORT 24 October
Off the south coast we have reports from several charter operators catching snapper off Island Bay.  
It’s spawning time for the snapper between now and early in the new year so they will be moving in closer to do their thing.  Many people don’t realise the snapper move in, and when you can find them they tend to feed voraciously and can be quite easy to catch.
This is a good opportunity to get them on lures, which are very effective.  In particular, kabura style jigs, slow pitch jigs and Inchiku patterns are very effective out past the 40 metre mark, with soft baits and micro jigs being better in close right up to the weed line.
We are seeing more snapper than in the past herding up out here before they move into the harbour to spawn, usually around November, which is a very welcome addition to things for us fishos.  Around then you can expect to target them off the airport reefs.
If you do manage to get a really good fish and are tossing up whether to keep or return it, check the chin.  If it’s white you likely have a big breeding female, and if it has a grey smudge it’s a boy.  Over to your discretion on keeping or not, but the pannies definitely make better table fare.
If you are fishing off Island Bay, be aware to keep outside the marine reserve markers (see map).  The snapper population tends to move around a bit, so it’s a matter of locating them or bringing them in with a good berley trail.
Fitzroy bay is going well lately, producing good catches of terakihi, blue cod and gurnard with a few trevs thrown in for good measure.  Best in a North-East wind this bay has a wide open sand bottom with a few good patches of scattered reef that hold good fish.  Anchoring up and berleying will often bring the fish on, and stray lining or dropper rigs work well.  If you’re drifting, use a chute to slow the drift and get some soft baits or micro jigs down.  Trevally love micro jigs and the new tungsten ones from Catch Fishing are deadly on pretty much everything except terakihi.
Out a bit further Five Mile reef is good for big cod and terakihi in 50 – 75 metres if you fish the turn of tides when there’s not too much current running.
West Coast
The best snapper and kingfish have been caught on the northern end of Kapiti recently.
Hunters was full of terakihi last time we were there, with some big trevs and blue cod.
Kabura (slider type) jigs have been doing the damage on the snapper and kingis. Use the 150 gram versions if there’s a bit of heavy current running.  If there’s a lot of foul the small kabura hooks can be a bit touchy to put pressure on, so perhaps try some slow pitch jigs or inchikus that have a gruntier twin hook rig.
We eagerly await the warmer water and more consistent snapper fishing around Mana, Pukerua Bay and down to Makara. At the moment it’s a bit hit and miss.
The Trench
I’ve heard of some good trumpeter and hapuka on some of the seamounts south of Nicholson’s recently. That’s a place worth some serious investigation as it hasn’t been fished much by recreational anglers.
Best rigs are droppers with smaller (3/0) but solid recurve hooks.  These rigs are easily capable of handling good puka.  Come and see us in store for a bit more detail on all that.
Small bluenose are still biting well off Wainui in 120-180mtrs
Inner harbour
There are good gurnard and kahawai around Ward Island with the odd elephant fish and trevally.
Evans Bay is still full of gurnard as well as Point Jerningham, Halswell and Seatoun.
One or two snapper getting caught off Point Gordon and some nice teri’s there too.
The big gurnard run is slowing down a bit as expected, so they are not quite as reliable as they have been, no doubt at the tail end of their spawning.
Surfcasting
Greta point has been rampant one day and barren the next for gurnard. Some anglers have been getting good results slide-baiting Oriental Bay and moki fishing at White Rock.
It’s perfect timing for those places to start producing a few nice fish, so if the weather gives us a break anytime soon it’s well worth getting out there.
With typical spring winds being pretty merciless for boaties, the windows are small and you have to grab the opportunity where you can.  This long weekend there might be a bit of a chance on Saturday with northerlies predominating, but she’s pretty blowey for most of the next several days.














Generally, water temp can’t be too cold for snapper. Around fourteen degrees is normally the minimum with sixteen to eighteen degrees the best.
Sometimes you can throw the temp gauge away when the fish are really hungry, as is commonly the case during winter.
When we get a period of strong southerly winds, the snapper can go off the bite or go into deeper water where the temperature stays more constant.
With strong northerly winds, the snapper move back closer to shore and seem to be much more likely to then feed aggressively.  
During spawning time, which is normally when the water temperature reaches around eighteen degrees, the snapper move into an area
with the right ground attributes for laying their eggs.


Winter snapper can be a very good size and condition
This is normally nutrient rich areas commonly adjacent to large harbours and estuaries.
This transpires at different times of the year in different parts of the country normally from October through to March.
In Wellington it’s around February to March, whereas up north it kicks off much earlier in January to Feb where snapper can be caught
in good numbers right under the Auckland harbour bridge.  
‍
This February to March period is normally the peak of the snapper fishery in Wellington, with the west coast firing earlier than the inner harbour,
where fish may hold well into May.
In recent years there have been some excellent winter runs of snapper in 50-70 metres off Boom Rock and Hunters Bank,
extending down towards Ohau point right in to 20-30 metres.
In winter, baits will often work better than lures, and colder temps force the snapper’s metabolism to slow down.
This means fish are on the lookout for a big easy feed, and a bigger bait such as whole pilchard or squid can present an irresistible meal.
If you are fishing lures, slow the action right down, or use kabura type jigs that slowly waft around in the current.


Whole pillies - always a top snapper bait
In the mid to upper North Island, the snapper are present all year, and can even bite better in the winter, especially the bigger moochers.
The mass of snapper population often turns fish into very picky eaters over summer spawning months as their focus changes from eating to breeding.










Finding tarakihi in the Wellington Region
In Wellington, the south end of Mana Island in 30 to 50mtrs is good, but there are plenty of other spots all around the coast from
Palliser Bay right around north of Kapiti Island.
In fact, a bin of cod and teris is like bread and butter for Wellington anglers fortunately.


Vern’s and Hunter’s (70mtrs), south end of Mana (30-50mtrs), and the Makara fence line (25mtrs) are the areas to target.










Trip report 23 November 2025
Location: kapiti coast.
Tides: high 1130am, low 545pm
Swell: .8 to 1m
Wind: 8 to 14kts north westerlies
Well the plan was made for Mike and myself to get up 430am and be on the road by 530am to make the 2 hour trek south before making the 1.5 hour 5km walk into the where the rock is.
The walk was a great test for walk in missions for the new back pack and hiking boots which I have now got since doing the tosc comp to make things easier to carry.
Mike and ham got to the rock around 9 30 am
First time for both of us hitting this spot and wow, how amazing it is too, very cool place, we wastd no time getting out our gear setting up and getting into it.
Mike straight into stick baits and poppers, then he put a live out with a blood on one rod and kept casting with the other.
Ham wanted to see what other species were  around the rock.
He put a 2 hook ledger on and used Japanese razor belly  pilchards as bait.
Boom first drop got some under sized blue cod, the signs were good thay of there were small ones their would be bigger ones so ham kept going for them.
Mike through a couple of berley packs in and then the water came alive with heaps of kahawai swimming around and coming upto the surface.
Mike quickly put his stick bait away whilst the live stayed out incase any greenback showed up.
He then put a strayline out and boom kahwwai on, Mike was having fun smashing the kahawai, while ham was still getting blue cod,
Ham pulled in a double hook up and both blue cod we're an amazing green, blue color that really stood out when coming up.out of the water,  one was legal the other just under so home it went.
Ham got 4 legal blue cod a 33cm, 34cm, 34cm and 36cm.
Blue cod would have to be one of the best table fish so ham was determined to take a feed home.
Mike was still pulling in kahawai after kahawai and was pretty much saying I want that one then boom he would get it lol.
Ham thought he might put his ledger rig just under the surface then within seconds, kahawai on.
Time passed very fast then at 330pm we decided we had enough fun and it was time to pack up and make the long walk back to the ute.
No kingfish turned up this time.
Was a great day and im feeling it today with sunburn and being unfit lol.
Here are some of the pics I got whilst out their.
Video to come on our ham and cheese youtube channel.

Wellington Fishing Report - Landbased fishing productive
There have been good numbers of blue moki, trevally, and gurnard getting caught from the shore on the south coast recently. Places like White Rock, Ocean Beach, and Pencarrow have been productive. Wainui and Long Beach have also seen reasonable fishing.
Snapper have been getting caught inside the harbour now with some nice gurnard as well at places like Oriental Bay, Flat Rock, and Karaka Bay. There were a number of snapper caught at Te Horo last time it was clean and fishable, but lately it's been predominantly kahawai getting caught amongst the schools of whitebait, particularly around river mouths.
There haven’t been as many opportunities to get out on the boat with the predominant northwesterlies, but when fishable, a good number of snapper and kingfish have been taken, along with the usual mixed bag of cod, tarakihi, and trevally out west. The snapper have been more productive in the deeper water, but should start coming in close with the warmer water.
Out on the south coast, it's been business as usual with cod and tarakihi in the reefy areas from 40-100m, with the odd kingfish and snapper thrown in for good measure. Out deeper, there’s not too much to report lately with limited decent weather.
Harbour fishing should be good once the wind drops for snapper, trevally, and gurnard, if the shore fishing is any indication of what's around. The kingies haven’t turned up yet in close to shore, but it will only be a matter of time before the jigging and slide-baiting brigades start up.

Wellington Fishing Report - Blue cod on the chew
With Wellington's wild spring weather, any chance to get out is a good day out. On my most recent trip, I eyed up Tora on the east coast of the lower North Island with the stealth kayak. The morning started at 4am to head over the hill to meet the farmer at 6am as he went through his property for his rounds. I went to my normal spot which has a double bay with a rocky outcrop that acts as a natural break wall and lets you get out on rougher days.
As I paddled out, the seals scattered from the rocks and soon joined me out in 50m where they kept darting around until they all scattered and went back to shore. Now the mind always plays tricks on ya, but this time it got me thinking. What made them scamper back to shore? My mind got the better of me and I headed in shallower to one of my normal reefs in 25-30m where all the cod are good.
The cod came in thick and fast, all 40-plus cm with a few over 50cm. I had eight good cod and the wind and swell picked up, so I chose to head in as it was getting lumpy. After a quick pack down I headed back to the farmer to drop off a koha of three fresh cod. The five remaining big cod were much appreciated in our home for fresh blue cod tacos.

Wellington Fishing Report - Winter anglers rewarded
It’s been a classic weather pattern for fishing around Wellington lately. For those anglers venturing out, most have been well-rewarded with minimal wind and good fishing. From the boat, there’s great snapper fishing all the way up and down the west coast. Depths of 40-60m have been productive but the deeper and shallower spots have still been fishing well. Kingfish have been big and mean on most well-known haunts like Hunters, Boom, and Kapiti.
On the south coast, it's been a mixed bag of tarakihi, cod, gurnard, trevally, snapper and kingies. Hāpuku fishing has been good all around, but they will be off on their spawning run shortly. From the shore, good numbers of kahawai are around with some really chunky ones around the harbour and south coast. A few nice blue moki have been caught as well as some trevs, gurnard, and snapper in Palliser Bay.
There are a lot of sharks around at present, so I would recommend using shellfish/pāua/cray berley instead of fish-based berley to minimise sharky issues. Slowjigs and shellfish Fishbites artificial baits have also been working well throughout the winter months.

Wellington Fishing Report - Snapper, trevs and blue moki off the beach
On the surfcasting front, moki and snapper have been getting caught from Point Halswell to Scorching Bay with a few snaps and trevs around Seatoun as well. Kahawai have been increasing in numbers around Evans Bay, Seatoun, and on the south coast. There have also been a few kingies around, with one caught in Lambton Harbour and a massive 28kg model speared recently around the Red Rocks/Karori area. A few decent squid getting caught around the wharves as well.
Offshore, it’s ‘puka season! They are in peak condition prior to spawning in August/September. Good reports have come in from Turakerei, Karori, Ohau and Fishermans Rock. Snapper are still around in good numbers with more chunky (3-5kg) fish getting caught.
A couple of bluefin tuna have been caught off Cape Palliser/Tora by recreational fishos recently. Winter fishing in Wellington is productive for multiple species including warehou, gurnard, trevally, kahawai, blue cod, and tarakihi, plus the deepwater treble of bass, bluenose and puka.

Wellington Fishing Report - West and South Coast Updates
West coast: Before these gale northerlies came in there were a number of good snapper getting caught by boaties from Makara to Kapiti and by surfcasters from Paekakariki northwards. We have noticed more large blue mackerel around recently with a few warehou turning up as well. Trevally have also been common.
South coast: Trevally, gurnard, and blue moki are expected for surfcasters on the south coast over the next month. Inshore fishing for boaties has been a mixed bag with the odd good haul of blue cod and tarakihi. The harbour is holding plenty of kahawai and gurnard. Squid fishing continues to be productive from the inner harbour wharves.
Whitebaiting: A few good feeds of whitebait are getting caught from various places. I would try some of the smaller rivers where there are fewer nets out.
October 5, 2023
Wellington Fishing Report - Shore and Boat Updates
Shore and land-based: There were good numbers of gurnard caught over the weekend with the main spots being the inner harbour wharves, around Pt Jerningham and through to Evans Bay. Kahawai have been all go some days. One or two snapper and elephant fish have been caught as well. Whitebait had a big run about 10 days ago.
Boat: There are plenty of spring gurnard about with some nice trevally and snapper. Places to try include Ward Island, Pt Gordon, and Pt Jerningham.
Kapiti Coast: Excellent snapper fishing when you can get out.
April 18, 2024
Wellington Fishing Report - Snapper star amongst banquet of species
Kapiti Coast: Some nice snapper have been caught off the local beaches but it has been running hot and cold. Boat fishing has been much more consistent with albacore, kingies, and snapper (to 10kg) in good numbers.
Mana/Makara: Snapper have been pretty consistent with mixed bags of tarakihi, blue cod, gurnard, trevally, and hordes of kahawai. Out deep, the ‘puka fishing has been consistent of late.
Wellington Harbour: Boat fishing has been very consistent for snapper, particularly around Ward Island, Somes Island, Point Gordon, and Evans Bay. From the shore, it has been kahawai city recently.
South Coast: Excellent blue moki and snapper about, with a nice 17kg king caught at Ocean Beach recently. Out wider, the fishing has been consistent for ‘teras’ and blue cod.
October 4, 2024
Wellington Fishing Report - Good snapper out west
There are good numbers of gurnard around in Evans Bay and on the south coast. A 20lb snapper was caught off the Plimmerton Boating Club wharf recently and a couple of nice moki were caught off the south coast.
There are good snapper out west, with nice warehou, kingfish, trevally and gurnard around. It’s off-season for ‘puka but there's still bass and bluenose around at the trench. October also sees the arrival of blue moki and hāpuku in our waters post-spawning. Whitebait have been running well at most river mouths.
November 15, 2024
Wellington Fishing Report - Boat and shore anglers doing well
Landbased: Good numbers of moki have been caught at White Rock and the Spit. Some good trevally fishing at places like Seatoun, Pencarrow, and Ocean Beach. Good numbers of gurnard have been caught in Evans Bay, Clyde Quay, Halswell, and Raumati. No verified kingfish landings yet but they have been seen.
Boat: The best snapper fishing has been from Kapiti northwards. There have been a few good hauls of bluenose and ‘puka out in the trench and some nice bass too. In the harbour, there are plenty of gurnard and kahawai with a few trevs around Point Gordon and Ward Island. Finally, there’s the usual good cod and tarakihi fishing on the south coast.


March 7, 2025
Wellington Fishing Report - Fish peaking The fishing is going off! We are certainly in the peak of the great Wellington fishing summer. March/April is probably the best time of the year to fish for snapper, kingfish, hāpuku, kahawai, and various gamefish species like tuna and marlin.
Unprecedented fishing in new places has been the theme this year. Hot spots have included Seatoun Beach for land-based kingies and snapper; out wide from Mana northwards for albacore tuna, marlin (about eight caught so far), mahimahi, and even some short-billed spearfish. Palliser Bay (surfcasting moki and snapper), Falcon Shoal (harbour boat fishing) for snaps and kings, and Raumati (snapper surfcasting) have also offered great rewards.
The season has been one of the best on record but has also been running red hot one day and stone cold the next, particularly for snapper. They have been spooked by temperature contrasts and potentially spawning, making them tricky to catch. It’s been a pleasure to see many new anglers catch their first moki, snapper, kingfish, and tuna this season.
February 20, 2025
Wellington Fishing Report - Marlin opportunity Multiple striped marlin have been caught out from Foxton, with a few hooked around Kapiti as well. There are plenty of albacore tuna out wide on the west coast.
With better weather and the La Niña pattern, things have improved—particularly for boaties. The snapper have come back on the chew with good catches reported off the shore and from boats. The harbour is going off with kingies, snapper, and other species as well.
January 24, 2025
Wellington Fishing Report - Landbased kingfish firing There’s finally been an improvement in the weather, and the snapper are starting to come back on the feed out west from Makara northwards. Surfcasters have been seeing some good snapper fishing on the Kapiti Coast as well.
Land-based kingie action in the harbour has been pretty good, with many catches between 10-20kg around Evans Bay, Oriental Bay, Seatoun, and the Hutt River entrance. When the wind drops, there’s been good hāpuku fishing, including some in shallow water (15kg fish in 50-60m). Boat fishing around Falcon Shoal has been really good for snapper recently. Some good blue moki have also been caught at Ocean Beach, the Wainui coast, and around Scorching Bay and Kau Bay in the harbour.
February 11, 2022
Wellington Fishing Report Wellington surfcasters are starting to get among the snapper, with the best bite being after dark. The Kapiti region has been a top producer, while harbour anglers have also had success. Kingfish have shown up along with snapper at Evans Bay, Eastbourne, and Palliser Bay. The best snapper reported is a trophy 20lb+ fish from "the spit."
White Rock has been less productive but has rewarded some with moki and snapper. Boat fishers are enjoying action "out west," with snapper and groper on the chew wider out. One charter caught kingfish and snapper in depths of 170-230m. Off Kapiti, the snapper bite is consistent, and occasional smaller (10-15kg) southern bluefin tuna are appearing at the 50-70m mark out from Otaki and Foxton.
Nicholson’s Trench has provided hāpuku, bluenose, and gemfish when conditions allow. Closer inshore to the south, tarakihi, snapper, and kingfish have been found in the 40-60m range. Anglers are reminded to carry plenty of salt ice to respect and preserve their catch in the summer heat.
May 5, 2022
Wellington Fishing Report - Surfcasting going off Surfcasting is going off at the moment with heaps of snapper being caught on the Kapiti Coast and in Palliser Bay. There is also good blue moki fishing west of Red Rocks where the water is clean.
Boat fishers are producing good catches of snapper, tarakihi, trevally, and kingfish throughout the region. The better snapper fishing has been north of Pukerua Bay and south of Boom Rock. Harbour fishing is also going well around Evans Bay, Ward Island, and Point Gordon. There are heaps of Ray's bream around out west, found in mid-water from 70m downwards; they are great fun to catch and excellent for sashimi.
December 1, 2022
Wellington Fishing Report - Conditions ideal on both coasts Light winds have made all coasts fishable. For surfcasters, Palliser Bay has been productive with snapper, moki, and gurnard, specifically at Whangamoana, the Spit, and Ocean Beach. West of Red Rocks is also good for moki on the high tide. Evans Bay is seeing snapper, gurnard, and the odd kingfish.
The Kapiti Coast is providing good snapper at Raumati, Paekakariki, and Te Horo, especially at the change of light. Boat fishers at Kapiti have caught excellent kingfish and snapper. Mana has been slightly inconsistent, though a 40-50lb kingfish was recently seen and five nice snapper were caught south of the bridge.
Some nice hāpuku have been caught around Makara and Mana. The Trench has been good for bluenose and gemfish, including a 25kg "bluedog" recently. Snapper, trevally, and gurnard remain consistent around Ward Island, Point Gordon, and Falcon Shoal. Albacore tuna have appeared north of Kapiti in water temperatures of 15-18 degrees, raising hopes for the return of bluefin tuna.
